<p>Being a newly-minted California voter, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to my opportunity to exercise a little direct democracy tomorrow. (I&rsquo;m not taking a position on whether direct democracy is a good idea, but surely if it&rsquo;s there one might as well take advantage of it.) I encourage you to vote as well; indeed, I encourage you to vote the same way I do:</p>

<p><strong>Presidential Candidate for the Democratic Party:</strong> Barack Obama. Between Mike Gravel&rsquo;s inability to get more attention than a passing mention from Wikipedia and everybody else dropping out, the choice is apparently down to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Hillary is the kind of sellout DLC centrist who <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/09/politics/main1600694.shtml">cozies up to Rupert Murdoch</a>; Barack Obama can hardly be worse. Still, <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/10/sb-a-little-bit-more-on-obama-1161881683">he&rsquo;s sold out too</a> and I vote for him under the illusion that he&rsquo;ll somehow revert to his community organizing, Iraq War-opposing, progressive old pre-sellout self sometime before becoming President. False hope springs eternal.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 91:</strong> No. So bad, even its supporters are asking you to vote against it.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 92:</strong> Yes. Community college is important and previous propositions have been screwing it over for years.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 93:</strong> Yes. Progressives seem to oppose term limits, on the grounds that they &ldquo;shift[] more power to the governor and ensur[e] that the State Assembly and the State Senate will be filled with people who lack the experience and institutional history to fight the Sacramento lobbyists (who, of course, have no term limits)&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=5430&amp;volume_id=317&amp;issue_id=335&amp;volume_num=42&amp;issue_num=16&amp;l=1">SFBG</a>). I&rsquo;m not so sure, but this seems like a fairly modest proposal which seems to strike a reasonable balance.</p>

<p><strong>Propositions 94-97:</strong> No. The only people in favor of expanding the casinos while reducing their oversight seem to be their lobbyists.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition A:</strong> Yes. Parks are nice.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition B:</strong> Yes. Everyone seems to support this and if police officers want to work three more years, who am I to say no?</p>

<p><strong>Proposition C:</strong> Yes. I know rationally this is an absurd proposal, but when you&rsquo;re there, in the privacy of the voting booth, looking at whether a geodesic dome should be built on Alcatraz Island, who&rsquo;s going to stop you from voting yes?</p>
