> Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please;
> they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under
> circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.
> The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the
> brains of the living.

(Karl Marx, [The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
Napoleon](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm))
