A new service called [Bandwagon](http://ridethebandwagon.com/) is
launching soon that automatically backs up the music libraries of iTunes
users to Amazon S3 for a flat rate. It looks very cleanly-designed; if
only they did it [for your whole hard
drive](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/lazybackup).

*Disclosure:* By posting this blog post, theyâ€™re giving me a free
one-year account.
