**WARNING:** This whole thing is one gigantic spoiler. Only read it if
you’ve already tried to figure it out for yourself first.

Gately, having relived his bottom, begins to recover from his infection.

But at the same time, Hal’s condition deepens. Ever since Hal ate the
mold as a child, he’s been a brilliant communicator but unable to feel.
(694: “Hal himself hasn’t had a bona fide
intensity-of-interior-life-type emotion since he was tiny … in fact he’s
far more robotic than John Wayne.”) JOI was the only one who could see
it. In life, everyone thought JOI was just being crazy but in death (as
a wraith) he can actually read Hal’s thoughts and thus confirm his view.

In life he created the Entertainment to draw Hal out (Hal moves
outwardly but doesn’t feel inside; victims of the Entertainment
feel—something—inside but don’t move outwardly). After all, as he tells
Gately, he was willing to resort to desperate measures: “No! *No!* *Any*
conversation or interchange [between father and son] is better than none
at all.” (839)

JOI’s wraith is responsible for the strange disturbances around ETA —
tripods in the forest, moving Ortho’s bed, ceiling tiles on the floor.
He knocks the ceiling tiles down in an attempt to find the DMZ. Pemulis
is too distracted with getting expelled to have Hal take it, so JOI
needs to get it to Hal some other way.

JOI also created DMZ as part of an attempt to undo the effects of Hal’s
eating mold as a child (recall: DMZ is a mold that grows on a mold). He
left it along with the Entertainment (recall: ETA kids find JOI’s
personal effects (670: “a bulky old doorless microwave…a load of old TP
cartridges…mostly unlabelled”); the tapes and the DMZ are delivered
together to the FLQ) which is about this goal (it stars a woman named
Madame Psychosis (a street name for DMZ) explaining that the thing that
killed you in your last life will give birth to you in the next). The
DMZ and the Entertainment were meant to go together for Hal. Now that
the Entertainment has escaped, he needs to get Hal the DMZ.

Hal never leaves leaves his toothbrush unattended (870), but that’s no
problem for a wraith. He places the DMZ on Hal’s brush and Hal brushes
his teeth (860) and immediately begins experiencing symptoms: Ortho
thinks Hal’s crying when Hal thinks he’s speaking in a neutral tone
(862).

Hal’s symptoms indeed begin to reverse: he is now unable to properly
communicate feelings (people see him as either laughing hysterically or
terribly sad) but beginning to actually feel (like Gately, he spends a
lot of time lying on the floor thinking about the past — the hero of
nonaction from his essay (142)). While before, everyone could hear him
*except* JOI; now *only* JOI can hear him (since, as with Gately, he can
hear Hal’s thoughts).

By the time of the match, his symptoms are so bad he’s taken by
ambulance to the hospital (16: “the only other emergency room I have
ever been in [was] almost exactly one year back”), safely escaping the
A.F.R.’s assault. Like fellow student Otis P. Lord, he gets the bed next
to Gately. Joelle (who is at the hospital for a meeting) visits Gately
on her way out and recognizes Hal. She tells them both about the hunt
for the lethal Entertainment and the resulting Continental Emergency and
they all go to dig up JOI’s grave. They persuade John Wayne, a spy for
the A.F.R., to become a double agent and help sneak them into JOI’s
Quebec burial site. Wayne presumably tells the A.F.R. he is actually a
triple agent — that he will steal the tape as soon as Hal digs it up.
But, as with Marathe, his loyalties are ultimately even-numbered (n40).
The A.F.R. finds out and brutally murders him, which is why he can’t win
the WhataBurger (16f).

As Gately forsees:

> Late*. (934)

It’s too late because someone got there first and took the
anti-Entertainment cartridge (126) embedded in JOI’s head (31). Whoever
took it is presumably the person who’s made and mailed the extant
copies. It couldn’t be the A.F.R. or O.U.S. or they wouldn’t still be
searching for it. It probably wasn’t the F.L.Q. because they didn’t know
how to read master cartridges—they just thought they were blank tapes in
their displays were blank. (483n205) It couldn’t be Avril acting alone;
she has problems but she’s not that kind of cold-blooded killer. It had
to have been Orin.^[1](#fn:o)^

Orin (who never attended his father’s funeral) went to the gravesite and
dug up his father, releasing the wraith in the process. (244: “After a
burial, rural Papineau-region Québecers purportedly drill a small hole
down from ground level all the way down through the lid of the coffin,
to let out the soul, if it wants out.”) Orin, who is such a partisan of
his father that he feels the need to repeatedly ruin the lives of people
like his mother, has been mailing the tapes to his father’s enemies in
revenge: disapproving film critics in Berkeley and the medical attaché
(whose affair with his mother drove Himself especially wild) in Boston.
It’s possible he’s being influenced by the wraith in these actions.

After the A.F.R. releases roaches into his giant glass tumbler, Orin
cuts a deal with the A.F.R. and gives them the tape in return for
letting him live. (He’s apparently still alive on p. 14.) The A.F.R.
uses the tape to set off some sort of intracontinental conflagaration
(16: “some sort of ultra-mach fighter too high overhead to hear slices
the sky from south to north”) which apparently topples the Gentle
administration (n114: “[Y.G. is] the very last year of Subsidized
Time”).

As seen in Chapter 1, Hal’s condition deepens until he literally can’t
communicate at all, but no longer feels like a robot anymore. (12: “I’m
not a machine. I feel and believe.”) The only thing he has left is
tennis and he looks forward to playing Ortho Stice in the final match of
the WhataBurger. But Stice is possessed by his father (in the
manuscript, Stice is called “the Wraithster”), so the novel ends as Hal
finally gets to really interface with his father — in the only way he
has left.

1.  Recall that “the padded mailer [received by the attaché] is
    postmarked suburban Phoenix area in Arizona U.S.A.” (36) Also, Orin
    mentions being “in line in the post office” even though, as Hal
    points out, “You hate snail-mail. And you quit mailing the Moms the
    pseudo-form-replies two years ago.” (244) Orin doesn’t reply to
    that.

    And: “There was reason to think M. DuPlessis had received his
    original copies from this relative, an athlete. … [He] may have
    borne responsibility for the razzles and dazzles of Berkeley and
    Boston, U.S.A.” (723) The other appearances of the Entertainment are
    New Iberia LA (Orin played football in New Orleans LA) and Tempe AZ
    (Orin lives in Phoenix AZ). (Thanks to [Greg
    Carlisle](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0976146533), p. 477, for
    catching these.) [↩](#fnref:o)
