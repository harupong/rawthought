One of the hazards of dorm life is that fire alarms are always going
off. At Stanford, here’s how it went the three or four times it happened
last year: an alarm would go off, I wouldn’t hear it because I was in my
room with my headphones on or asleep, eventually I’d notice or get woken
up, I’d throw on my pants and walk downstairs and outside, where a group
of kids would accumulate. After what seemed like an interminable wait in
the shivering cold, a fire truck would show up, the firemen would walk
inside and, after a couple minutes, walk out again. Then everybody would
go back into the building even though nothing was actually explained.

As it turns out, it worked much the same way here at MIT, except they
have a new high tech talking fire alarm in every room to recite a
paragraph of instructions — twice — before telling you to leave the
building. When I got outside, there were much fewer people (it is summer
after all) but and the fire trucks showed up much more quickly. And
there were two of them! And after that, some policemen in their blue
uniforms. And then, inexplicably, a gray MIT-logo van pulled up and a
bunch of fat guys in suspenders (but no uniform) got out and went
inside.

But still, no explanation.
