Science Summaries

Anybody who’s ever read so much as a Malcolm Gladwell article or an
Alfie Kohn book knows that science can be fascinating, that its attempts
at answering our questions not only can have a real impact on our lives
but are interesting in their own right. Wouldn’t it be great if there
was a place that reported these things?

If this exists, please tell me — I’d love to read it. But if it doesn’t,
I’d like to start one. Here’s the idea:

We have a bunch of contributors, each of whom reads a variety of
journals or journal summaries. When they come across an article that
seems particularly interesting, they write up a one or two paragraph
summary of the experiment and the findings aimed at an intelligent but
generalist audience along with a link to the actual article.

So here’s an example of what this might look like:

> Economists at Cornell and Indiana University tried to see if
> television causes autism. Thinking that rainfall could cause kids to
> watch more TV and thus induce autism, they looked at county-level data
> in California, Oregon, and Washington — states with high variability
> in rainfall — and found that autism was was correlated with rainfall
> (R\^2=.77). Thinking that the use of cable TV was another random
> variable that increased autism, they looked at similar data in
> California and Pennsylvania and found the use of cable TV correlated
> with autism (R\^2=.21).
> [[Paper](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/profiles/waldman/autpaper.html)]

(I probably screwed up the R\^2 bit, but that’s why I’m looking for
other people to write these.) Of course, this particular study got lots
of media attention (that’s why I knew about it), but I’m hoping that
with enough contributors we’ll uncover interesting studies that don’t
make it into the general news.

So the contributors write a paragraph like this and send it in to an
editor, who posts it to a blog, where people can subscribe and comment
and so on like any other blog.

I’m happy to set up the blog and serve as the initial editor, so what I
really need are contributors. Do you read journals or other reports of
new science? If so, either post here (be sure to include your email so I
can contact you!) or email [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com) with
a list of the journals or news sources you read and would be willing to
go thru.

Or, if you have comments on the idea, feel free to post those too.
