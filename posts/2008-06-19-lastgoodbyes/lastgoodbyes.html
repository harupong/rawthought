<p>It&rsquo;s minutes to midnight and I&rsquo;m hurriedly packing. Early tomorrow morning I catch a flight to Boston and start <a href="http://aaronsw.com/weblog/movingon">my new life</a>. I haven&rsquo;t really gotten much of a chance to pack until now, because I&rsquo;ve spent the past few days in a rush of meetings, getting in my last goodbyes for everyone I know in San Francisco.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been great seeing everyone, but like most locals, they&rsquo;re all puzzled as to why I&rsquo;m leaving. I&rsquo;ve been struggling to explain why. When I say the weather, everyone just laughs. When I say San Francisco is too loud, they start arguing. When I say it&rsquo;s the people, they tell me to find a better group of friends.</p>

<p>And the thing is, they&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s none of these. I&rsquo;ve been spectacularly unable to articulate it, but the real answer is simpler and more prosaic. And now, after great thought and struggle, I realize the answer is simply this: <em>Cambridge is the only place that&rsquo;s ever felt like home.</em> It&rsquo;s that simple. And when you put it that way, it&rsquo;s clear why I have to go.</p>

<p>So goodbye Stanford, goodbye Palo Alto; goodbye south bay, goodbye peninsula; goodbye Change Congress, goodbye Creative Commons; goodbye Mission, goodbye SOMA; goodbye friends, goodbye loved ones; goodbye San Francisco, home to everyone I&rsquo;ve ever loved. You&rsquo;ll always have my heart.</p>
