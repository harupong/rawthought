<h1>The Politics of Wikis</h1>

<p>Anarchism has a pretty bad rap. Put aside all the people who think it&rsquo;s about smashing windows and shooting presidents and just focus on the idea (<em>an arch</em> &mdash; without rulers). If someone told you that you should start a business where basically no one is in charge of anything and everyone shares ownership of everything and all decisions are made by consensus, you&rsquo;d think they were a hopeless utopian about to get a large dose of reality. Yet that&rsquo;s pretty much what Wikipedia is.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the obvious anarchism of wikis: namely, &ldquo;anyone can edit&rdquo;. No intelligence tests or approval rules or even a temporary probation. Anyone can just wander up and hit that edit button and get started. Where in the world can a random person get a larger audience?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty radical in itself, but things go much deeper. There&rsquo;s no ownership over text. If you write something, as soon as you post it to Wikipedia, it&rsquo;s no longer &ldquo;yours&rdquo; in any real sense. Others will modify and mangle it without a second thought and anyone who quotes those words in the future will attribute them to &ldquo;Wikipedia&rdquo; and not to you. In a culture where directors are suing people for fastforwarding over the smutty scenes in their movies, that&rsquo;s pretty wild.</p>

<p>And while there are a few technical tricks to give some people more software features than others, for the most part the Wikipedia community is pretty flat. Every non-edit decision, from which pages get deleted to what the logo in the corner is, gets made by consensus with everyone getting a chance to have their say.</p>

<p>In real life, few people are willing to take such a radical stand. Even the farthest reaches of the far left hold back from proposing such extreme ideas, suggesting that not only that such extreme freedom wouldn&rsquo;t fly in a capitalist culture like ours, but that perhaps some of these restrictions are just necessary because of human nature. But it&rsquo;s humans who edit Wikipedia, and mostly humans raised in capitalist culture as well. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to give more extremism a chance.</p>
