It seems like every Western food culture has some combination of bread
and cheese as a meal. Americans, simple people, have your basic grilled
cheese. But Italians have the pizza. Then there’s the mac-and-cheese.
And of course Mexicans with their quesadilla. Then there’s the cheese
calzone. Not to mention cheese crepes. Throw in meat and you can also
count the famed cheeseburger.

What is so magical about this combination?
