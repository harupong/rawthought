<p>It was Halloween, after all, so we donned costumes and headed to Harvard Square. (&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; people asked me. I looked them straight in the eye, scrunched up my face to look a little angry, and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dot-com millionaire&rdquo; with utter seriousness. That was my costume.) Alexis carried a sack of candy, Steve a sack of shirts. People in all sorts of bizarre costumes waited for the train.</p>

<p>We grabbed dinner at Border Cafe. Alexis handed out candy and shirts to the waiters while flirting, and offered to bribe them into voting for him in the Halloween costume contest.</p>

<p>I ordered a meal, but couldn&rsquo;t make myself eat it. The food just sort of seemed to stick in my mouth, each swallow painful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what are you going to buy first?&rdquo; someone asked each of us. When it came to me, I stared blankly. I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything I wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to pay for the check?&rdquo; Steve asked. &ldquo;Oh, wait. I just realized, for the first time, that it&rsquo;s relevant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards, we walked down Church Street back to Harvard Square. There were a bunch of young girls loitering. Alexis struck up a conversation. &ldquo;Want some candy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; they all cried. He opened up the pillowcase. &ldquo;Want some shirts?&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, sure,&rdquo; they laughed, and started fussing over colors and sizes. It was the strangest transformation, two mild-mannered guys suddenly become showmen, a horde of girls at their feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s times like these I wish I was a <em>Vanity Fair</em> reporter,&rdquo; I tell Chris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s reddit?&rdquo; the girls asked as they tried shirts on. &ldquo;Oh, it used to be a website.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why are you girls all just standing here?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for the <em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>! You should come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. Well, we were going to go get crunked.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you can get crunked and then come see it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We demurred and continued on, finding a flock of well-suited men, visiting from other countries, who fell for the same trick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to give this to my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we walked to a bar, we passed three young girls in bunny costumes who Alexis tried to pick up. The oldest-looking one wanted to hang out with us, thought it would be fun, started giggling suggestively, a glimmer into a pasttime I didn&rsquo;t understand (my feeling is &ldquo;men suck&rdquo;, on both sides of the equation). But despite her best efforts, her two younger-looking friends shied away and wanted to just go to <em>Rocky Horror</em>. There was a struggle, and I saw the girls walking towards the bar and away from it several times after that.</p>

<p>By the time we finally reached the bar, my head was pounding and my stomach was nauseous, and I didn&rsquo;t want to go in, I didn&rsquo;t want to be here, I didn&rsquo;t want to know these people. I went home instead and watched a show about a serial killer and found myself identifying with the lead.</p>

<p>When I woke up the next morning, my head was fuzzy. And while I saw the costumes strewn about the floor, the girls brought home who slept in our living room, the odd emails asking me what I&rsquo;d do next, I still felt funny. For a shining moment in the morning, it felt as if this whole acquisition thing might have simply been a dream.</p>
