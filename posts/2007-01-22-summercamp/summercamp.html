<p>Ten calls are coming through on my cell phone at once. I try to answer them in order. Finally I get to my mom. &ldquo;Just wanted to see how you are,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Oh, by the way, Alexis called the cops.&rdquo; I try to treat this as nonchalantly as she is, but mean while I&rsquo;m running to find my pants. I don my gray hoodie, grab my keys, lock the door behind me, and run out into the street, finally saying goodbye. I just make it &mdash; I see the cops coming in front of my door as I make it to the next block.</p>

<p>I know exactly what to do in these kinds of situations; I&rsquo;ve seen it in all the movies. Turn off the wireless on the cell phone, pay for everything in cash, don&rsquo;t use RFID cards, stick to sidestreets. I stick to sidestreets, but I still hear the cop sirens buzzing down all the major roads. There are major roads on every side of me.</p>

<hr>
<p>The lady across the aisle from me on the plane is pleading with the flight attendant. She holds her small dog between her legs (&ldquo;oh, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she had explained, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll stop barking once we take off&rdquo;), covered in only a blanket. The attendant is down on his knees, trying to understand what she wants. He disappears and later I see the woman pouring a small bottle of alcohol into her drink.</p>

<p>Apparently this was a mistake. The woman starts screaming profanity, locking herself in the bathroom, running up and down the aisles. Finally, she&rsquo;s forcibly restrained. The pilot comes on loud over the intercom, thanks us for our patience, explains that you&rsquo;re not supposed to mix alcohol with certain psychoactive medications, tells us law enforcement will be meeting us at the gate.</p>

<p>Law enforcement meets us at the gate. &ldquo;Please remain in your seats,&rdquo; comes the pilot&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Law enforcement has taken control of the air craft. No one is permitted to move until law enforcement releases its control of the air craft.&rdquo; Law enforcement relinquishes the air craft and as I exit I see the woman, with a couple policeman in front of her, asking her if she can see the fingers they&rsquo;re holding up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; I think. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just go through this yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<hr>
<p>I forgot how much I hate San Francisco. The bus takes an hour to arrive, while I have to stand in the human filth of the city. For some reason they put the major bus transfer point at the same place drug dealers congregate. It&rsquo;s not a very fun place to wait.</p>

<p>I finally get home and tumble into the mat that makes up my bed.</p>

<p>Next thing I remember I&rsquo;m in the Moscone Center. MacWorld is over, but a few signs and people are still around. I look out a window for a bit and a guy taps me on the shoulder. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re trying to punk Paul Graham in that room,&rdquo; he says, pointing. I go and see.</p>

<p>Paul Graham is indeed in that room, as is his girlfriend and my co-founders and the other Y Combinators I know and a bunch of people I don&rsquo;t recognize (probably this year&rsquo;s batch of Y Combinators). They start surrounding me. I begin to suspect a trap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; I ask Steve. &ldquo;Wait a second, you brought me here, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Steve replies. &ldquo;I mean, I remember going to sleep, I remember kind of wanting to wake up, but then all of the sudden I&rsquo;m in the Moscone Center? How did I get here? You must have brought me here, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steve denies all knowledge, but there&rsquo;s a gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>The people surrounding me take a step closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a deal. If I can tickle every last one of you, I go free. Otherwise, you win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They seem to accept the deal.</p>

<p>I begin tickling.</p>

<p>People begin running, dodging, flying around the room. But I&rsquo;m like a heat-seeking missile. I track down every one of them, extend my hands out, go straight for their armpits.</p>

<p>I win.</p>

<hr>
<p>I wake up on my mat. The sun is shining brightly. It&rsquo;s a beautiful day. I whistle a happy tune. I go to wait for the bus. One bus goes by, it&rsquo;s too full to stop. Another comes by after what seems like an eternity. It&rsquo;s almost as full, but I&rsquo;m not going to wait for yet another. I hang from the bar overhead, just barely fitting inside. There&rsquo;s no room for my feet.</p>

<p>The bus gets off a couple blocks from my office. To get there, I have to walk past the Moscone Center. That&rsquo;s when it comes back to me. I look hard at the Moscone Center. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;It must have been a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Goooood Monday morning,&rdquo; I say, entering my office. That&rsquo;s kind of my little thing, my little ritual. &ldquo;Goooood XXX morning,&rdquo; I say in a happy voice, replacing the XXX with the name of the day I&rsquo;m saying it on. I only say it once each day.</p>

<p>My co-worker is ignoring me.</p>

<hr>
<p>I am presented with a letter accepting my resignation. I am told to collect my &ldquo;personal effects&rdquo;. A woman from HR politely escorts me from the premises. She never says that she is escorting me, but she does stand behind me wherever I go. I think I am supposed to leave.</p>

<p>I leave. The sun is shining brightly. It&rsquo;s a beautiful day.</p>
