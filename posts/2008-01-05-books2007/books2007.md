*Previously:* [2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)

This year I only read 70 books, down from over 120 last year. I guess
that’s not too bad considering this was the Year of Other People — I
still beat my general goal of 52. Once again, here are the books that
struck me as completely worth reading. This year, though, I’ve
intermixed them with the other books I read:

-   Fight Club, Palahniuk
-   The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager
-   The Crying of Lot 49
-   Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track, Feynman

George Orwell, *[Down and Out in Paris and London](http://www.orwell.ru/library/novels/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London/english/)* 
:   The original *Nickeled and Dimed*, Orwell lives as a plonguer and a
    tramp in Paris and London respectively. The descriptions of such
    poor conditions are typically riveting and a great deal of
    fascinating reflection is included throughout.

-   When Prophecy Fails, Festinger et al
-   Classical Experiments in Psychology, Mook
-   Rhetorical Occasions, Berube ([reviewed
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rhetocc))
-   Incompleteness, Goldstein ([reviewed
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/godel))
-   Our Underachieving Colleges, Bok ([reviewed
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/underbok))
-   Way Out There In The Blue, FitzGerald ([reviewed
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intheblue))
-   No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart, Slee ([reviewed
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nobodyshops))
-   The Mystery of Consciousness, Searle ([commented on
    previously](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/searle))
-   Play It As it Lays, Didion
-   The Blind Side, Lewis

Hugh Laurie, *[The Gun Seller](http://books.theinfo.org/go/067102082X)* 
:   Hugh Laurie, the British actor (Americans know him as Gregory House,
    M.D.), takes his first crack at writing in this comic novel. (The
    novel was originally sent to publishers under a pseudonym to avoid
    celebrity favoritism, but naturally sales forced him to publish it
    under his real name.) The plot is a fairly standard spy-guns
    thriller, although very well executed, but the book’s brilliance is
    the way it adeptly undermines its own cliched language, to hilarious
    effect. In that way it’s a lot like the British TV comedy *People
    Like Us* (itself well worth seeing). A good, fun read.

-   Founders at Work, Livingston

John Searle, *[Mind, Language, and Society](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465045219)* 
:   This book combines, in abbreviated form, the arguments in all of
    Searle’s work up to the time of its publication (which is basically
    everything except *Rationality in Action*). In doing so, it
    basically has all the hallmarks of Searle’s work, only more so: a
    clear exposition of complex philosophical ideas that demonstrates
    how to think better, useful tools to help you understand your world
    better, and genuine philosophical solutions that let you resolve
    confusions you may have had before. And all of it is done with
    Searle’s customary wit and style — almost an anti-style, like that
    of D. J. Bernstein, in which he simply explains things clearly and
    concisely. A model of public philosophy.

-   Freedom and Neurobiology, Searle
-   The Rediscovery of the Mind, Searle
-   Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Lindsay
-   Mind, Searle
-   Applied Ethics, Singer (ed.)
-   The Plato Cult, Stove
-   Responsibility and Control, Fischer and Ravizza
-   The Game, Neil Strauss ([previously
    reviewed](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/thegame))
-   My Way, Fischer
-   The Social Misconstruction of Reality, Hamilton
-   Adam’s Fallacy
-   Intentionality, Searle
-   Writing in America
-   Intuition
-   Who Rules America?
-   Knowledge and Wonder
-   Things You Should Know About Captain Rick
-   Send In The Idiots
-   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson
-   The Occupation

David Lodge, *[Small World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140072659)* 
:   A strong, fun novel, packed with interesting ideas and characters
    and gimmicks, telling the story of people I love to read about:
    jetsetting academics. I’m normally not one for novels, but I have to
    admit it: Lodge makes it work. My only caveat is that this is part
    of a trilogy and one should probably read the first book, *Changing
    Places*, first, since later books refer back.

Adrian Tomine, *Shortcomings* 
:   Short, meaningful, and elegant. More than you could reasonably
    expect from such a book.

-   Conspiracy Theories: The Philosophical Debate
-   The New Ruthless Economy
-   Luria, Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations
-   Wall Street Noir
-   Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures

Saul Alinsky, *[Rules for Radicals](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679721134)* 
:   Including this is not quite right, because I cannot actually
    recommend this book without reservation. Alinsky is an anecdotalist,
    not a writer, and the first half of the book drags as he forces
    himself to come up with some general platitudes and lecture the
    youth of today. The second half, however, is incredibly fun and
    gives you an excitement and energy about accomplishing things with
    power politics that you just can’t get anywhere else.

:   Sadly, there aren’t any good alternatives I can recommend. Alinsky’s
    biography, *Let Them Call Me Rebel* by Sanford Horwitt, is quite
    good but has a few serious failings. First, it drags a great deal in
    the middle between the beginning of Alinsky’s career, in which he
    worked for Al Capone as research for his University of Chicago
    sociology dissertation, and the end, when he organized the black
    neighborhoods of Chicago and Rochester to fight the white
    establishment. During these middle years, Alinsky didn’t do much
    except watch three wives get sick and die and the book spends
    several hundred pages watching it happen. (Also, frustratingly, the
    book seems to be exhausted by the time it gets to the interesting
    end part and covers it in less detail than one would like.)
    Furthermore, the biographer apparently has come to severely
    disapprove of his subject, especially his habit of exaggerating or
    inventing stories about himself, that his disapproving tone takes
    all the fun out of the action.

:   Another possible alternative is Michael Gecan’s *Going Public*.
    Gecan is one of the top people in the Industrial Areas Foundation,
    the foundation Alinsky started and ran for most his life. *Going
    Public* is his attempt to go back to writing (apparently his college
    career) and tell the stories of the battles he fought as an IAF
    organizer. Gecan has much more of a flair for writing than Alinsky,
    but never got the chance to develop his editing skill, and the
    result is an uneven, sometimes overwritten, book. Also, Gecan’s IAF
    is much more watered down than Alinsky’s ever was and some of his
    tactics just seem downright silly.

:   There’s also Alinsky’s first book, *Reveille for Radicals*, but this
    can be dismissed as coming out during the early part of career,
    before some of the most fun stuff. So, because of the extreme
    importance it had on this year and because I have no serious
    alternatives, I have to recommend *Rules for Radicals*, along with
    everyone else.

-   Culture War?

Brian Morton, *[Starting Out in the Evening](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0156033410)* 
:   I read this entire novel in one sitting and it touched me in a
    profound way. It asks what it means to dedicate your life to
    writing, by looking at four people who come together, each of which
    has taken a different position in the New York intellectual scene.
    It’s also recently out at a film, which is a very bizarre experience
    to watch, because the book takes place almost entirely in the
    characters’ heads while the film will have none of that and only
    shows the brute actions. I’m not sure other people will have the
    same experience I did, but as a writer I found this book very
    powerful. By the same token, I’m looking forward to this year’s
    *[All the Sad Young Literary
    Men](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670018554)* (and gleefully downing
    the new issue of *[n+1](http://nplusonemag.com/)*).
