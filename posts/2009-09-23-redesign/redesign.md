Redesign

I was going through my weblog archives the other day and found an early
post I’d written *nine years ago* (in yet another piece of blogging
software I’d written myself…). But what was even more shocking than the
notion that I’d been blogging for over a decade was that my web design
back then was better than it was today.

This really kept nagging at me, so I took a couple hours tonight to do a
redesign. I still have very little in the way of [positive artistic
talent](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2taste), so it’s nothing
impressive, but I do hope that it will keep me from recoiling in horror
from my own weblog. My apologies to everyone I borrowed design features
from.

Feel free to use this thread to comment on the redesign.
