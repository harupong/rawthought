The densest cities in America, [according to the 1990
census](http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html#tabA):

1.  New York, NY (7M people over 309 sq. mi.)
2.  San Francisco, CA (.7M in 47)
3.  Chicago, IL (2M in 227)
4.  Boston, MA (.5M in 48)
5.  Philadelphia, PA (1.5M in 135)

Maybe there is something to my wanting to move to Philadelphia after
all.

Everyone’s been complaining about how I’m too critical, too much of a
downer. Well, here you go: it’s **the nice week**. Five posts on five
cities saying only nice things. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
