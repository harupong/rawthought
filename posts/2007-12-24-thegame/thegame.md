I have to admit, there’s a part of me that gets no small enjoyment out
of the fact that the first piece I wrote for a paying publication is
nominally a review of a book on pick-up artists that actually ends up
spending most of its time on glosses the history of American dating,
discussions of foundational experiments in control of the emotions, the
history of behaviorism in psychology, and the computer functionalist
philosophy of mind. In other words, the typical article for *Other*.

I originally planned to post the review here to my blog, but instead I
bumped into Annalee Newitz while I was writing it, she expressed
interest in it so I sent her the draft I had and next thing I knew it
was getting included in the next issue of the magazine. Reading back
over it, I’m not sure I have a more to say in its favor other than it’s
definitely the weirdest review of *The Game* that will likely ever be
published.

A couple paragraphs got removed in the print version I have and the
editors added subheads to break up the flow, but here’s the original
piece as I sent it to them:

If you like this kind of thing, consider picking up [a copy of *Other*
magazine](http://othermag.org/), available in indie bookstores across
San Francisco and thru the web site.

(*Explanation in advance:* I know fans of computer functionalism (what a
weblog to have such readers!) are going to attack me for my
oversimplification of their views. Well, if you want, I’m happy to
attack your views at length and the conclusion comes out basically the
same. So bring it on.)
