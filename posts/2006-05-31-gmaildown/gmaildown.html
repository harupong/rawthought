<h1>Gmail Down</h1>

<p>My Gmail account has been down for over two days. When I try to log in, it says it&rsquo;s down for maintenance and they don&rsquo;t know how long it will take. When I try to get my mail through POP, it simply doesn&rsquo;t work. And when I contact the Gmail people, all I get back is form responses. I&rsquo;ve used Gmail as my mail client for the past couple years, so if you&rsquo;ve sent me mail and I haven&rsquo;t responded &mdash; that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>The thing that really puzzles me is <em>why</em>. I can understand occasional outtages, but I can&rsquo;t understand what could cause my account to go down for days, unless they lost my data and are too embarassed to actually tell me. The only thing I can think of is that something went wrong and there&rsquo;s just no one around to fix it. Which, considering Gmail&rsquo;s popularity, would be kinda sad.</p>

<p>Sorry to bug you with my personal problems, but obviously it&rsquo;s time for me to switch away from Gmail. I&rsquo;ve been careful to always keep my email going to my main server, so I haven&rsquo;t lost too much data, but figuring out a way to read my mail again is rather difficult.</p>

<p>I get absurd quanities of spam (40,000 spam messages a month) so my mailboxes are just full of junk. And it&rsquo;s not clear to me how to clear it out. A bayesian filter like bogofilter requires non-spam messages to train on &mdash; and if I had my non-spam messages, I wouldn&rsquo;t need a spam filter. Spamassassin seems to work better, but it&rsquo;s incredibly slow and inaccurate, taking a couple seconds per email (at this rate it will take days to see my mail again).</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions (or you&rsquo;re a person at Google who can turn my account on again) feel free to help. If you want to email me, I&rsquo;m checking &ldquo;feeds@reddit.com&rdquo;.</p>
