<h1>What Makes a Personality Scary?</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed recently that I sometimes find myself a little afraid of people&rsquo;s personalities. It&rsquo;s kind of a weird experience: it makes sense to be afraid of people and other things that can hurt you, but being afraid of a <em>personality</em>? It doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. Personalities can seem quirky or interesting, but scary?</p>

<p>At first, I thought this was simply an odd personal tic, since you don&rsquo;t exactly hear anyone else talking about it. But on reflection, you sometimes do. Imagine a movie, the heroine character learning about some shocking evil deed the brave male lead has committed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know who you are anymore,&rdquo; she sobs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re starting to scare me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s frightening, it would seem, is that people aren&rsquo;t the way we expected. They seemed to be brave and kind-hearted, but when the moment was right they were capable of being crafty and manipulative. We&rsquo;re shocked, at first, because it&rsquo;s not what we expected. &ldquo;But he seemed so nice&hellip; How could he do that?&rdquo; Then we&rsquo;re upset, because at some level it seems like dishonesty. &ldquo;He made me think he was a good person, yet he&rsquo;s capable of so much bad.&rdquo; And finally, we&rsquo;re scared, because if we were wrong about him, then our view of the world seems a little bit off.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Having the world be off is frightening. I remember once I found myself at Caltrain&rsquo;s Milbrae station late at night. Milbrae is a huge new station, a sprawling complex complete with a subway, 10 bus stops, a train, and a huge parking garage. There&rsquo;s nothing really around it for quite a bit and it&rsquo;s all open-air, with the cold night air chilling me in my shirt, as I was transferring between the subway and the train. On the way to the train tracks, I checked the schedule. The next train was at 10:47 it said; it was 10:40, so I hurried downstairs to wait for the train. I sat down and got out my book, waiting, and waiting, while the train never came. I checked the clock &mdash; it was past 10:47, well past. So I checked the downstairs schedule. There was no 10:47 train. I ran upstairs to see if the schedule I&rsquo;d read was simply out-of-date. It had no 10:47 train either, nothing even close. I was certain I had read it saying 10:47 &mdash; the memory was clear in my mind, and I&rsquo;d followed the line with my finger to make sure I had the right station.</p>

<p>I suddenly got quite scared. What was going on? Was I in a dream? Was someone sneaking around the schedules on me? Was I the victim of some practical joke? The fabric of my reality was being torn &mdash; something clearly impossible had happened: a time had disappeared off a train schedule. Things weren&rsquo;t working the way I expected.</p>

<p>I later figured out, of course, that nothing so devious had happened. In my hurry to catch the subway, I&rsquo;d read the wrong side of the schedule &mdash; the train was at 10:47am, not 10:47pm, and when I went back to look for the time I looked at the right side of the schedule and, naturally, the train wasn&rsquo;t there. But my larger point is that tears in the way we think things work are scary. If things are this bad when a piece of paper doesn&rsquo;t say what we expect, it&rsquo;s not surprising that it&rsquo;s worse when people we know don&rsquo;t behave the way we thought.</p>

<p>I say we here, but as I mentioned at the start, I seem to be a bit alone on this. One possibility is that I&rsquo;m hypersensitive to such emotions. Other people might simply feel a prick at such a scheduling anomaly, but I feel it as full-blown fear. Another (more flattering) possibility is that I&rsquo;m more perceptive about people than others; since others don&rsquo;t notice the duplicity, they don&rsquo;t feel the associated fear.</p>

<p>The latter makes some sense to me, as the things that make me scared of people are often very subtle, and others don&rsquo;t seem to recognize them at all, even when I ask them about it specifically. Even I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on what it is sometime, it&rsquo;s just a subtle signal that the person isn&rsquo;t being straight with you, that what they&rsquo;re saying sounds honest and friendly, but is actually manipulative. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant feeling.</p>

<p>In talking about this sequence of emotions (shocked, upset, scared), I&rsquo;m referring to a logical progression, not an actual one. I don&rsquo;t really feel all of these things in order upon seeing someone scary, just the last. But the other emotions are what gets you to the last.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
