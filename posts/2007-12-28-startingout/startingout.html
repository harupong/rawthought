<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you discover a person&rsquo;s true nature,&rdquo; someone in <em>Starting Out in the Evening</em> thinks: &ldquo;by the way she wakes up in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time, I have woken up in the morning with nothing. Recently, because I have been sick. Before that, because I was split up among many jobs. Before that, because I nominally had a real job. I miss the days when I woke up with purpose, when I lived to toil at some grand accomplishment. The feeling that all of life is in the service of some larger goal. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I have been finally getting over my too-long illness, nursing myself back to strength by reading. When I was a kid, I used to take Saturdays to read, really read, devouring five or six books in one sitting. I haven&rsquo;t read like that in years, but now I&rsquo;m doing it again &mdash; checking out stacks of books from the library and setting upon them one by one. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t just breeze thru the pages, I roll around in bed and pace the floor and sit in the bath fighting my brain around their words, knowing that there&rsquo;s some way it all makes sense, some way it can fit together, if only I can summon the strength to grab it. I wake up with thoughts of books in my heads, questions, anecdotes, stories. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I feel like the books are bringing me back &mdash; back not only to health, but to the world of thought and action, the world of accomplishment, the world of doing something grand with oneself. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
