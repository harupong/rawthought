Writing a Book: Part Two (Structure)

I’ve always wanted to be a great writer, but nobody’s ever explained
how. So I tried to figure out for myself. I reread my favorite books, I
read just about [everything by David Foster
Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/David_Foster_Wallace_nonfiction)
and [Robert Caro](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245), I read a lot
of *New Yorker* articles, I got caught up on
*[n+1](http://www.nplusonemag.com/)*. I read a lot of stuff out loud, to
get a feel for the sound of the voice. (I performed all the brief
interviews (including the powerful “On His Deathbed…”) in *[Brief
Interviews with Hideous
Men](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316925195/booksinfo-20/ref=nosim/)*
— incredible fun; I can completely see why it made John Krasinski want
to become an actor.) In fact, it got to the point where I couldn’t
resist reading things out loud — some writing just begged to be
performed.

I read some writing guides, but none of them were very helpful. Virginia
Tufte’s *[Artful Sentences](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0961392185)* was
by far the most interesting, but I’m not sure it was much practical
help. I’ve had the best luck with just reading great writing and then
taking a stab of writing something of my own.

I also tried to figure out how to structure the writing. I watched Ira
Glass give his standard talk seven or eight different times, I read
Mamet’s *On Directing Film*, I sat down with Malcolm Gladwell’s
*Outliers* and tried to take it apart and figure out how it worked. For
some reason, even though the basic ideas are really simple, they’ve
taken me a really really long time to understand. It’s quite odd,
really. I saw Ira Glass say the same thing 8 times, but only on the 7th
time did I walk away going “Ohh, that’s what he means!” And I keep
having similar obvious epiphanies.

I think part of the problem is that I was around a lot of really bad
storytellers as a kid. My Dad would tell a joke and it would take so
long that I would be tearing my hair out with boredom halfway through.
When it was over I would think, “Wait, that was the joke? I can tell
that joke in two lines. What did he need all those details for?” And
since then I’ve basically been the person who tells jokes in two lines —
omitting needless words, using only the barest description, and getting
very impatient with people who run long (which was basically everyone,
it seemed to me).

I don’t know if I’ve begun reading better writers or grown more patient
with age, but I’m beginning to question this approach. Being spare and
interesting is better than being prolix and boring, I’m still convinced,
but there’s a place for the seemingly-irrelevant detail. For one thing,
what makes a story a story is the irrelevant detail. Ira Glass
demonstrates this by quoting the opening of his show
“[Cringe](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1134).”

(You can listen to it on the site there — just click “Full Episode” on
the left side. It’s the first three minutes. It’s much better listened
to, but if you can’t, here’s a transcript:)

Yes, why? Not so much why do we cringe, but why do we listen so raptly?
As Ira Glass is the first to point out, it’s kind of a boring story on
its face. It takes him three minutes to tell, but I can tell it in two
lines: *A guy named Joe once mistook a midget for a nine-year-old. He
cringes every time he tells the story.* For the purposes of the show,
that’s all he needs to say — the purpose of the story is to set up a
show about cringing, and just the idea of mistaking a midget for a
nine-year-old is pretty cringeworthy. But he tells the story *at
length*: except for the very end, he doesn’t appear to try to summarize
it at all.

And yet, not only do people not get bored — this is apparently what
*keeps* them from getting bored. (Imagine how quickly people would tune
out a show of two-sentence stories. Personally, I don’t have to imagine
— I see how bored they look when I tell mine. Which, of course, only
makes me rush to tell them faster.) Glass argues that humans are somehow
hardwired for stories. Once they get started, we *have* to hear what
happened next. “One thing happens, and then another thing, and then
another thing,” he says. “It’s got its own momentum — it’s like a train
leaving the station.”

I think Ira is being too modest. He’s an incredibly gifted storyteller;
obviously one of the era’s greatest (his show is the \#1 podcast on
iTunes). What looks like a simple recording of someone telling a story
is the result of a thousand different questions and edits and
adjustments. There’s a lifetime of experience behind every pause, every
lilt of his cadence. To keep listeners hooked on a story is a very
difficult skill.

But what I didn’t realize was that it’s also a necessary one. Stories
that go by too fast may not be as annoying as stories that are too slow,
but they’re still flawed. I’m too insecure to think my storytelling
could possibly hold the listener’s attention, so I rush through the
story, hoping to tell them all the key facts before they get bored and
wander off. But it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you seem
uninterested in your story, why should your listener be? If you’re going
to tell a story, you need to bite the bullet and be a storyteller.

The trick is realizing that the apparently-irrelevant details aren’t
actually irrelevant. Look again at my transcript of Joe’s story. There’s
only one thing I see in it that could be cut out: that “it’s early in
the morning.” Incredibly, every other line in that three-minute story
serves an important purpose.

Picking a sentence at random, “She was an incredibly sweet kid.” is
necessary because Ira’s comment “That’s sweet.” sounds odd by itself, it
needs a response. (Ira’s comment is necessary to make sure you see the
chasing-down-the-hallway in the right emotional tone. (That scene, in
turn, is necessary to explain the kind of relationship he and the girl
had, and so on.)) A three minute story, and there’s hardly a clause you
can cut.

* * * * *

That’s the first rule of storytelling: a story needs to be interesting
in its own right. But the second is equally important: the audience
needs a reason to care. I think part of the reason we’re wired to follow
stories is because a story carries an implied promise: there’s going to
be something good at the end of this.

The way Ira puts it is that there are two tools in storytelling: action,
and reflection. Ira’s shows (like Gladwell’s articles) open with action.
But the action leads immediately to reflection: look at the story above,
there’s not even a pause between the ending of the story and Ira asking
why it is that we cringe. Ira’s not just telling the story because it’s
entertaining, he’s telling it because it makes us cringe and he wants us
to think about that feeling.

He goes on to investigate that feeling — to explain what we can learn
from the story. And here again it’s important to slow down. There’s a
tendency to think that stories speak for themselves. First, because
there’s some artistic nobility in this: explaining what a story means is
being “didactic” and “preachy,” it’s keeping your readers from thinking
for themselves, it means your work isn’t really art. Second, it often
seems unnecessary: you’ve spent hours — days, weeks, months, years —
thinking about your story. It seems obvious to you what it means. Maybe
you can add a sentence spelling it out for the slow ones, but isn’t that
enough?

It’s not, of course. Your head is full of evidence, examples, models,
implications — all of which your readers aren’t just going to magically
intuit. You need to tell them.

Again, I think I was betrayed by bad writing in my youth. I read a bunch
of “popular” books that were just dreadful. I didn’t know that these
books weren’t actually meant for reading. Turns out, you get paid about
the same amount for writing a truly great magazine article as you do for
a mediocre one and only get a little more attention for the former. So
if you write a really good magazine article, the only way to get
rewarded is to turn it into a book.

The problem is that even the longest magazine articles don’t make for
more 30 pages and you can’t really publish a book that short. So you
write a couple hundred pages of filler. And, in most cases, that only
detracts from your great article by watering it down. You basically just
end up repeating yourself a lot in different words. As a child, I
couldn’t stand books like that and vowed never to write one.

But again I went too far. It’s true, you don’t need to give three
examples of everything you say, but you can’t simply give no examples
either. I’m still trying to figure out where the right balance is.
