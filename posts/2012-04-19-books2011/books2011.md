The 2011 Review of Books
========================

April 19, 2012

* * * * *

*Previously:* [2010](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010),
[2009](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009),
[2008](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books),
[2007](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007),
[2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)

2011 was a stressful year, in many ways, and so for large parts of it I
did not really read. [Instead, I
tracked](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As8ovKAdyK-hdGJEd3h3eWpjaWhHRndFS3loOW1sTmc&hl=en_US#gid=0)
how many books I started and how many pages I got through each, for a
total of 112 books started, 70 finished, and over 20,000 pages read. Not
up to my usual standards. Nonetheless…

**Key:** Books in bold are those that were so great my heart leaps at
the chance to tell you about them even now. If you only have time to
read some of this, read those.

1.  *[The Net Delusion](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586488740)* by
    Evgeny Morozov

    Surprisingly well-written and well-researched.

2.  *Managing Oneself* by Peter Drucker

3.  ***[The Halo Effect](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743291263)* by
    Phil Rosenzweig**

    [Last year](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010), I recommended
    *Good to Great*, calling it “actual science”. [Dave Bridgeland
    quickly corrected me](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010#c8)
    and recommended this book, which is vastly better. Not only does it
    systematically debunk the pretensions to science in *Good to Great*
    and the other management bestsellers in an absolutely delightful
    manner, it provides a short but very thought-provoking discussion of
    strategy in its own right.

    You can mock the banality of its recommendations, but there’s no
    question: this book is well worth it just for the way it encourages
    habits of genuine scientific thought. I knew I never should have
    fallen so low as to trust a business book!

4.  *[The Farnsworth Invention](http://books.theinfo.org/go/057366286X)*
    by Aaron Sorkin

    Clearly not Sorkin’s best, but short and fun. Also interesting to
    see how Sorkin plays with the fourth wall in a play format.

5.  ***[The Trial](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805209999)* by Franz
    Kafka (translated by Breon Mitchell)**

    A deep and magnificent work. I’d not really read much Kafka before
    and had grown up led to believe that it was a paranoid and
    hyperbolic work, dystopian fiction in the style of George Orwell.
    Yet I read it and found it was precisely accurate — every single
    detail perfectly mirrored my own experience. This isn’t fiction, but
    documentary.

    *Spoilers follow.*

    The bulk of the book is about K trying to find someone to fight his
    case for him, and failing miserably. As an individual in a world of
    bureaucracies, he concludes [there’s no
    substitute](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/delegation) but to do the
    work himself.

    This is set against the backdrop of his “day job” at the bank —
    about as characteristic a bureaucracy as you can imagine. The bank,
    by contrast, has no difficulty finding people to do its work for it.
    Even when K slacks off or gets distracted, the bank continues
    chugging along just fine — as seen in the vice president who leaps
    to take K’s work from him. (Compare: The independent lawyer is under
    no such pressure to actually get K’s work done.)

    A vivid illustration that bureaucracies, once they get started,
    continue doing whatever mindless thing they’ve been set up to do,
    regardless of whether the people in them particularly want to do it
    or whether it’s even a good idea. At the same time, individual
    people have an incredibly hard time executing long-term or
    large-scale tasks on their own, even when they’re quite motivated.

    But what of the priest? The priest tells K a story about how as an
    individual in a bureaucracy, it’s a losing game to try to ask
    permission. You have to persuade your boss, your boss’s boss, and
    your boss’s boss’s boss (so terribly powerful that your boss can’t
    even bear to look at him). If you wait for your request to be
    approved by the chain of command, it won’t happen at all.

    K argues with the priest about how horribly unfair this is: isn’t
    your boss (the individual) doing the wrong thing somehow? The priest
    maintains there are many different theories about this question of
    individual responsibility. But K is missing the larger point: this
    is just how bureaucracy works.

    K takes the lesson to heart and decides to stop fighting the system
    and just live his life without asking for permission. It goes
    well…for a while. But it still seems a better option than the
    alternatives.

6.  *The Great Stagnation* by Tyler Cowen

    A dreadful little book, which boils down to nothing more than a vast
    tract of economic illiteracy. Take just the insanity that is chapter
    2. Cowen takes as his dictum:

    > The larger the role of government in the economy, the more the
    > published figures for GDP growth are overstating improvements in
    > our living standard.

    For example, as government-insured health care takes up a larger
    proportion of our country’s spending, we can’t accurately measure
    how our living standards are improving since it’s paid for at set
    rates by government instead of through a competitive market process
    to set accurate prices.

    But, as any economist should realize, our standard of living is
    *never* appropriately measured through prices, because of consumer
    surplus. The *whole point* of a competitive economy is to create
    this disconnect. Let’s say a chair greatly improves my standard of
    living and I would pay \$10,000 for one. In a competitive market,
    different chair providers compete for my money by offering a lower
    price, eventually driving the price of the chair down to the cost of
    production.

    Has my ‘living standard’ [*sic*] thereby decreased? Of course not!
    In fact, it has increased since I can buy several chairs (while
    still getting thousands of dollars in consumer surplus!). It’s
    insane to blame this on government.

    Cowen’s other arguments are similarly ignorant. For example, he
    tries to claim that the reason we’re in a recession, “not filling
    government coffers or supporting many families”, is because “our
    major innovations are sprining up in sectors where a lot of work is
    done by machines, not by human beings. … That is one reason why we
    have been seeing a ‘jobless recovery.’” (L503)

    Nonsense on stilts. [The Federal Reserve
    decides](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whynojobs) how many people
    will have jobs, iPads have nothing to do with it.

    This book’s popularity is a sad sign of how ignorance triumphs when
    it benefits the powerful.

7.  *[Lifted](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B004K1F9KG)* by Evan Ratliff
    ([iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-atavist/id408059276?mt=8&ls=1))

    A fast, fun real-life heist story.

8.  *[Getting Things Done](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142000280)* by
    David Allen [reread]

    Still good, though not worth starting a cult over. Its insights are
    more psychological than anything else.

9.  *[Private Firms Working in the Public
    Interest](http://www.rand.org/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD212.html)*
    by Abigail Bugbee Brown

    Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Olympus — why is there so much accounting
    fraud? Why isn’t this stuff caught? In this serious but
    briskly-written work, Abigail Brown explains the incredible story of
    how accounting firms actually work. Paid by the people they’re
    supposed to be auditing, accounting firms have developed an
    elaborate culture of corruption, letting them aid and abet the most
    egregious forms of dishonesty.

    (Disclosure: Ms. Brown and I were lab fellows together at the
    Harvard Center for Ethics.)

10. *QED* by Peter Parnell

    Not bad, by any stretch, but on the page, for anyone who’s familiar
    with Feynman’s actual writings, this can’t help but feel thin.

11. *Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself* with David Foster
    Wallace

    After a great artist dies, there comes a point where the barrel of
    work that can be published posthumously seems like it’s running dry
    (Elliot Smith’s *New Moon*, Kafka’s *Office Papers*). Publishing the
    transcript of a rambling conversation with DFW as a book would seem
    to be similarly stretching.

    But, like the others, it turns out to be appreciated all the same.
    DFW is delightful and witty and it’s fascinating to see how much of
    his linguistic creativity and charm wasn’t the result of any special
    effort but simply his natural form to speech. He must have been such
    a delight to spend time with.

    The problem is that the editor of this volume, David Lipsky, is
    apparently a dreadful writer who is deluded into thinking he’s a
    great one. Taking DFW’s polite words of support as deep praise, he
    is not shy about sharing his ‘gifts’ via overwrought introductions
    and interpolations. The result is an infuriating combination of
    glorious rants from DFW cut with ignorant and ill-written
    speculation by someone desperate to show off. (Though I don’t recall
    Lipsky’s recent piece about DFW being so bad, so maybe he merely
    needed an editor…or was told to pad the book out with random
    asides.)

12. *Inside WikiLeaks* by Daniel Domscheit-Berg

13. *[Brainiac](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0812974999)* by Ken Jennings

    Who knew Ken Jennings was so funny? A witty and delightful book,
    though obviously not one that’s anything more than trivial.

14. *[From Dictatorship to
    Democracy](http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html)* by Gene
    Sharp

    A short but impressive guide to how to run a democratic revolution.
    Reportedly rather influential and certainly provides an interesting
    structure for thought.

15. *[Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime
    Underground](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307588696)* by Kevin
    Poulsen

    A fun and intriguing book. Poulsen writes in a restrained style, but
    the pace is fast and the images are vivid and the technology seems
    pretty right-on.

    (Disclosure: Kevin Poulsen and I worked together at Wired.)

16. *[Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund
    Manager](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0051BNV4U)* by Anonymous Hedge
    Fund Manager and Keith Gessen (with n+1)

    An annotated transcript of a series of interviews between the
    brilliant literary writer Keith Gessen and a sympathetic and
    polymathic hedge fund manager. The hedge fund manager tries to
    provide some insight into what his world is like, in real time as
    it’s collapsing, but Gessen’s questioning typically isn’t detailed
    enough to get a very vivid picture. HFM’s stories were thrilling as
    things happened but with distance they seem somewhat blurred; it’s
    harder to fit them in now that we think we understand what happened.
    They’re both delightful characters, though, enough to still make the
    book a decent read.

17. *[The Watchman: The Twisted Life and Crimes of Serial Hacker Kevin
    Poulsen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316528579)* by Jonathan
    Littman

    Whatever ese you want to say about Kevin Poulsen, he was certainly
    funny. Littman provides a vivid retelling of his strange story. I’m
    told Poulsen denies most of what’s in this book, so it may not have
    much value as documentary, but as entertainment it’s pretty good.

18. *Tourist Season* by Carl Hiassen

19. *Strip Tease* by Carl Hiassen
20. *Skinny Dip* by Carl Hiassen

    Carl Hiassen writes murder mysteries with a political bent. They’re
    fun airport reading but it’s hard to justify them as much more than
    that.

21. *[Scoop](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316926108)* by Evelyn Waugh

    This book, the source of the name *The Daily Beast*, is a vicious
    satire of journalism. It has some quite witty and biting moments,
    including some I’ve found myself referring back to, but I’m not sure
    it holds together as literature.

22. *The Age of WikiLeaks* by Greg Mitchell

    An good, well-written summary of the story so far, but nothing more
    than that.

23. *JSTOR: A History* by Roger C. Schonfeld

24. *Team Rodent* by Carl Hiassen

    A very short book packed full of muck about the Disney Corporation.
    Fun stuff, but it comes off as very light — basically just a list of
    stories Hiassen seems to have picked up in his years of living
    nearby.

25. *Shots* by David Fenton

26. *At a Slight Angle to the Universe* by William Bowen
27. *[The Honor Code](http://books.theinfo.org/go/039334052X)* by K.
    Anthony Appiah

    A collection of interesting stories about how social revolutions
    have happened. Appiah tries to tie them together with a story about
    honor, but I think that’s ultimately less interesting and persuasive
    than just reading the stories themselves.

28. *The Case of the Speluncean Explorers: Nine New Stories* by Peter
    Suber

29. *The Story of Colors* by Subcomandante Marcos

    Absurdly, a children’s book by Subcomandante Marcos. As weird as
    you’d expect, but not as good as you’d hope.

30. *[The New-York Historical Society: Lessons from One Nonprofit’s Long
    Struggle for Survival](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0787901873)* by
    Kevin Guthrie

    A compellingly-written and fascinatingly-told story of how the
    New-York Historical Society, a grand old museum housing countless
    invaluable treasures, was so consistently financially mismanaged
    that despite its greatness it found itself constantly on the verge
    of financial ruin. Clearly written as a cautionary tale for those
    who would run a non-profit.

31. *[The Pale King](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316074233)* by David
    Foster Wallace

    In his notes, David Foster Wallace described this unfinished book
    about boredom as one where “something big threatens to happen but
    doesn’t actually happen”. As a result, it’s probably less unfinished
    than it feels. It has the usual DFW virtuosity with language
    (including some truly poetic sections) and a tax-related premise
    that somehow captures the entirety of this political moment the same
    way *Infinite Jest* captured the cultural one, but there’s certainly
    nothing in the way of a plot the way there was in *Infinite Jest*.

32. *[Bossypants](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316056863)* by Tina Fey

    This book is like a literary cupcake: a small bombshell of sugar
    without very much in the way of substance. I believe I read the
    whole thing while sitting in an airport terminal and while I enjoyed
    it and laughed, it’s hard to claim I took anything away from the
    experience.

33. ***[Poor Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586487981)* by
    Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo**

    God, what a book! *Poor Economics* is a series of tales of
    foreigners trying to save the far-flung poor, while failing to
    realize not only that their developed-country ideas are terrible
    disasters in practice, but also that everything they’ve learned to
    think of as solid — even something as simple as measuring distance —
    is far more fraught, and complex, and political than they ever could
    have imagined. It’s a stunning feeling to have the basic building
    blocks of your world questioned and crumbled before you — and a
    powerful lesson in the value of self-skepticism for everyone who’s
    trying to do something.

34. *The Filter Bubble* by Eli Pariser

35. *[The Psychopath Test](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594485755)* by
    Jon Ronson

    Another fun puff pastry of a book.

36. *[Empire State](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B0078XPQPG)* by Jason
    Shiga

    Reads a bit like Shiga trying to do his own version of
    *[Shortcomings](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1897299753)*. Not a bad
    book, by any means, but it has none of the Jason Shiga magic.

37. ***[Bookhunter](http://books.theinfo.org/go/097427156X)* by Jason
    Shiga**

    Words won’t do it justice: an action-movie-thriller of a book, a
    hilarious adrenaline-fueled ride that’s impossible to put down. I’ve
    never had this much fun with a piece of entertainment. Just sheer
    delight.

38. *[Meanwhile](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0810984237)* by Jason Shiga

    Not his best, but still entrancing and strange and very, very good.

39. *[He’s Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding
    Guys](http://books.theinfo.org/go/141690977X)* by Greg Behrendt and
    Liz Tuccillo

40. *[Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica
    review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars)*
    by John Siracusa
41. ***[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)*
    by Eliezer Yudkowsky**

    This is a book whose title still makes me laugh and yet it may just
    turn out to be one of the greatest books ever written. The writing
    is shockingly good, the plotting is some of the best in all of
    literature, and the stories are simply pure genius. I fear this book
    may never get the accolades it deserves, because it’s too hard to
    look past the silly name and publishing model, but I hope you, dear
    reader, are wiser than that! A must-read.

    As it says at the beginning, you really need to give it a couple
    chapters to get started before passing judgment — the first bunch
    are quite silly and it doesn’t seem worth sticking with until you’ve
    gotten past them.

42. *[In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our
    Lives](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416596585)* by Steven Levy

    Levy again does what he does so well: make an alien culture visible
    and comprehensible. A great guide to Google.

    (Disclosure: Levy once included me in an essay collection he
    edited.)

43. *[How to Count](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005DPIKPE)* by Steven
    Frank

    The first volume into what will surely be a wonderful introduction
    to programming. Certainly the best book on counting that I’ve read.

44. ***[The Inner Game of
    Tennis](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679778314)* by Timothy
    Gallwey**

    This book touched me deeply and made me rethink the entire way I
    approached life; it’s about vastly more than just tennis. I can’t
    really describe it, but I can recommend [this video with Alan Kay
    and the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos) that
    will blow your mind.

45. ***[The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning
    Organization](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385517254)* by Peter M.
    Senge**

    This book does not live up to its title — it has very little
    practical advice on how to create a learning organization — but
    still, it’s an important topic and I don’t know of anything better.
    It’s full of fascinating stories and provocations that will change
    how you think about business.

46. *[House of Holes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B007MXCUNS)* by
    Nicholson Baker

    I’m not normally one for filthy books, but Baker’s writing is so
    good that he somehow manages to make this one just utterly
    compelling despite the smut. I started reading and I couldn’t stop,
    he just draws you into his world of pure insanity.

47. ***[Rick Perry and his
    Eggheads](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005HE8ED4)* by Sasha
    Issenberg**

    Sasha Issenberg is a miracle-worker. This book (really an excerpt
    from his forthcoming book) is so very, very good that it just blows
    me away. Issenberg tells the tale of everything I’ve been trying to
    say to everyone in politics, but he does it in a real-life three-act
    morality play that’s so good it could be a model on how to tell a
    story.

48. *[Haiti: After the Quake](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586489739)*
    by Paul Farmer

    Farmer’s gripping personal story of returning to Haiti after the
    earthquake and seeing the devastation it had left, both physically
    and politically. It’s a personal narrative, not a work of
    investigative journalism, but it still provides powerful insight
    into what happened.

49. *[Confessions of a “Rape Cop”
    Juror](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LQV3CM)* by Patrick Kirkland

    When I first heard that the “rape cop” had been acquitted, I took it
    as yet another instance of a “rape culture” in which crimes against
    women go unpunished. This book persuaded me that we were all wrong.
    It’s a fascinating real-life story of what it’s like inside a jury
    room and what it really means to have proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt.

50. ***[The End of Loser
    Liberalism](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0615533639)* by Dean Baker**

    Dean Baker knocks it out of the park again — a must-read for anyone
    who cares about economic policy.

51. ***[The Lean Startup](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307887898)* by
    Eric Ries**

    Ries presents a translation of the Toyota Production System to
    startups — and it’s so clearly the right way to run a startup that
    it’s hard to imagine how we got along before it. Unfortunately, the
    book has become so trendy that I find many people claiming to swear
    allegiance to it who clearly missed the point entirely. Read it with
    an open mind and let it challenge you, so you can start to
    understand how transformative it really is.

52. *The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man* by Michael Chabon,
    illustrated by Jake Parker

    A short children’s book with absolutely gorgeous illustrations by
    Parker and a cute little story by Chabon.

53. *[Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone (Book
    1)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/059035342X)* by J. K. Rowling

54. *[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book
    2)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439064872)* by J. K. Rowling
55. *[Republic, Lost](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446576433)* by
    Lawrence Lessig
56. *[Flat Earth News](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0099512688)* by Nick
    Davies

    I’ve read a lot of books of media criticism and they all tend to
    trod similar ground: sensationalism, political bias, etc., etc. Nick
    Davies has written what is, in many ways, the same book — except he
    write it as an insider, not an outsider. As a result, he explains
    *how* the media gets to be this way, *why* it is as bad as it is —
    and he tells lots of delicious insider stories of incredible things
    he discovered that got cut or buried or distorted beyond all
    recognition. Davies is now famous for bringing down the Murdoch
    empire, but if more people read this book, perhaps he will bring
    down the rest of corrupt journalism as well.

57. *[Steve Jobs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1451648537)* by Walter
    Isaacson

    [Siracusa is right](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42): they got the
    wrong guy. The book is compelling and readable, there’s no doubt
    about that, but it tells a story that’s basically already been told.
    Isaacson is so clueless and uncurious that pretty much all of his
    “exclusive interviews” were wasted; there’s no insight in any of
    this, just weird lapses into authorial judgment.

    Robert Caro has said there’s one more biography he wants to write
    after he finishes LBJ. I dearly hope that it’s Steve Jobs.

58. *[Anything You Want](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1936719118)* by
    Derek Sivers

    I constantly find myself loving Derek Sivers’ blog posts, and while
    they feel eerily insubstantial collected together here, they’re
    still full of enough insight and good humor to make them well worth
    reading.

59. ***[CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and
    Software](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0735611319)* by Charles
    Petzold**

    A magnificent achievement. Charles Petzold starts with the story of
    two kids across the street who wish to communicate with each other
    and, from this simple beginning, builds up an entire computer
    without ever making it seem like something that should be over your
    head. I never really felt I understood the computer until I read
    this book.

60. *[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book
    3)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0439136369)* by J. K. Rowling

61. *[Masscult and Midcult: Essays Against the American
    Grain](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159017447X)* by Dwight Macdonald
    (edited by John Summers), with an introduction by Louis Menand

    Dwight Macdonald is one of those delightful cranks that you can’t
    help but love watching. Summers has collected a magnificent listing
    of things to watch — plus included an introduction that’s the
    incredible Menand at his best.

62. *[The Ghost [Writer]](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000WJSA6A)* by
    Robert Harris

    It’s hard to shake the feeling that a big part of the appeal of this
    book is watching Tony Blair get arrested for war crimes, but that
    doesn’t change the fact that it’s a first-rate political thriler.

63. ***[What It Takes: The Way to the White
    House](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679746498)* by Richard Ben
    Cramer**

    Were this just the story of how George H. W. Bush got elected, it’d
    be one of the few biographies that belonged in the same league as
    Robert Caro. But it’s so much more than that: Richard Ben Cramer
    gives the same treatment to dozens of candidates in the 1988
    presidential election: Gary Hart, Bob Dole, Joe Biden, Dick
    Gephardt, and on and on. Even if you didn’t care about politics,
    this book would be worth reading simply because the writing is so
    good. But if you do, there’s never been a better exposition of what
    drives these men who wish to be our leaders and what they have to go
    through to get there.

64. *[Joan: Forty Years of Life, Loss, and Friendship with Joan
    Didion](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005YF5RZO)* by Sara Davidson

    It’s hard to shake the feeling that this book is merely the author
    attempting to cash in on their minor friendship with Joan Didion,
    but I love Didion so much that I’m just grateful for the stories.

65. [*How a Book is Born: The Making of* The Art of
    Fielding](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B005LEWYYU) by Keith Gessen

    Gessen is an incredible writer and here he has the gift of getting
    to observe, first-hand, a heartwarming tale. A good story and a
    great introduction to the modern book business.

66. *[I’m Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number
    59](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0547737394)* by Douglas Edwards

    There were many, many times in this book that I couldn’t help but
    wonder: How did he get away with writing this? Google apparently
    approved of the project and had chaperones in all his interviews,
    but nonetheless the book is just full of revelations and shockers
    that it’s hard to imagine Google would ever want to see the light of
    day.

    There are a lot of books written about Google, but this has got to
    be one of the best. Edwards is uniquely suited to the task: his
    talents as a writer allow him to craft a compelling read, his
    insider’s view of the very early days give him a detailed knowledge
    from which to tell his story, but his total lack of cultural
    chemistry with the rest of the Googlers allows him to find
    mysterious all the crazy things which they all take for granted. A
    fantastic read.

67. *[The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and
    Practice](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1455523003)* by Christopher
    Hitchens

    Mother Teresa is a byword for saintliness, but have you ever stopped
    to ask why? Christopher Hitchens makes a convincing case that she’s
    something closer to a monster. Everyone I’ve told about this book is
    shocked by the concept, but it’s a short book with a pretty
    compelling argument.

68. *The Gated City* by Ryan Avent

69. *[Books I Did Not Read This Year: An
    Ebook](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2011/12/08/books-i-did-not-read-this-year-an-ebook/)*
    by Kieran Healy

    Healy is hilarious; this collection of blog posts was a delight.

70. *[The Devil and Sherlock
    Holmes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307275906)* by David Grann

    Grann is a masterful nonfiction writer; this is a collection of his
    pieces.
