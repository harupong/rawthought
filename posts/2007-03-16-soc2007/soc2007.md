Are you a student? Looking for a summer job? Here’s the deal: We come up
with an idea. You spend the summer implementing it. Google pays you
\$4500. The code gets released as free software. It’s called [Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).

Me and others on the web.py mailing list have [drawn up a list of
potential project ideas](http://webpy.infogami.com/ideas). My personal
favorites are the stats package, where you implement a decent log
analysis package for web applications; a task I think both exciting, not
too hard, and long overdue, and “teh communicator”, where you use Ajax
push to build a web app that combines the best features of IRC and
mailing lists. But feel free to come up with your own if you think you
have some good ideas. (Or ask me if you have questions about mine.)

Once you’ve got something that seems appealing, [fill out the
application
form](http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/web/guide-to-the-gsoc-web-app-for-student-applicants).
Describe the project you’re interested in working on and set the
organization to “Python Software Foundation”. Then feel free to send me
an email introducing yourself and letting me know about your
application. Applications are due next week, so you might want to hurry.

Once the applications are in, me and the other mentors will be looking
through them and deciding which ones to accept. So it’s in your best
interest to make the application sound compelling and you sound
competent.

And spread the word!
