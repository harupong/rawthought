<p>I remember when I was in fourth grade, while we were eating our snack (graham crackers and milk) in the kitchen, my classmates began discussing the effects of wealth. &ldquo;Money doesn&rsquo;t make you happy,&rdquo; I insisted. I tried to argue the point, but no one else believed me. (The same class was later adamant that Clinton should be impeached, although they did spontaneously throw an anti-fur-coat demonstration.) &ldquo;Of course money makes you happy,&rdquo; they insisted. &ldquo;Just wait, when you&rsquo;re rich, you&rsquo;ll change your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<hr>
<p>On TV, whenever a kid is given a to-him-large sum of money, the fatherly adult handing it out says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend it all in one place.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t want the kid blowing it on a single movie and then feeling bad that he spent it all. Someone emailed me the same thing the other day, and I had to laugh. I don&rsquo;t really know how to spend the money period. How could I possibly spend it all in one place? <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/US/9709/18/turner.gift/">Donate it to the UN?</a></p>

<p>A friend told me to be sure not to let the money change me. &ldquo;How could it possibly do that?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Well, first you&rsquo;d buy a fancy new car.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to drive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d buy a big house in the suburbs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I like living in small apartments.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d start wearing expensive clothes.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worn a t-shirt and jeans practically every day of my life.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d start hanging out with different people.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so shy I don&rsquo;t even hang out with the people I know now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For months, every time we thought we&rsquo;d really gotten somewhere on the Cond&eacute; Nast deal, we&rsquo;d get a call from Paul Graham. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say. &ldquo;Deals fall through.&rdquo; Whenever we passed him on the street, &ldquo;Deals fall through.&rdquo; In emails, &ldquo;Deals fall through.&rdquo; It got to the point that Alexis put up a photo of Paul Graham and captioned it &ldquo;Deals fall through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got an email from Paul Graham the other day. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Now you can get your hopes up.&rdquo;</p>
