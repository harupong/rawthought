<p>As inauguration approaches, speculation has been heating up about Obama&rsquo;s pick for the newly-created position of CTO. Most of the names floated &mdash; Eric Schmidt, Steve Ballmer, Jeff Bezos &mdash; just seem ridiculous (would you really leave being CEO of Google, Microsoft, or Amazon for a White House job?), but I&rsquo;ve recently heard one name that&rsquo;s gotten me excited: Princeton&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/">Ed Felten</a> (<a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten">blog</a>).</p>

<p>Felten came to national prominence in 2000, when the music industry held a contest to see if anyone could break their &ldquo;digital watermarking&rdquo; technology. Felten and his team broke it and was about to publish a paper explaining how, when the recording industry threatened to sue him if he did.</p>

<p>Since then, he&rsquo;s offered expert opinions on everything from Microsoft to voting machines and started the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton, which he directs, where he&rsquo;s pushed for more government transparency. He has the incredibly rare combination of being an absolutely first-rate technologist while also being able to clearly explain all of the relevant policy implications. Like <a href="http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=10525">Science Advisor John Holdren</a>, he&rsquo;ll do a fantastic job representing the consensus of technical experts on <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/predictions-2009">every policy issue</a> that comes his way.</p>
