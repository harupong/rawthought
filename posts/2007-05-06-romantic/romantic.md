> “romantic”—a curious word meaning all things to all people. From my
> point of view, it means that in [one’s] emotional relationships [one]
> should not be too bright—something, perhaps, that I should not state
> so baldly. But again and again the action of the [romance] novel’s
> plot is carried forward by our hero’s failure to realize that in any
> man’s life there are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of women who
> will do just as well; that he won’t die if he doesn’t win fair Susan’s
> dainty hand; and that very probably he will catch a most uninteresting
> variety of hell if he does win it. Which, come to think of it, is not
> unrealistic: emotional maturity is one of the rarest qualities in
> life.
