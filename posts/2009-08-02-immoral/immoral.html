<h1>Life in a World of Pervasive Immorality: The Ethics of Being Alive</h1>

<p>I used to think I was a pretty good person. I certainly didn&rsquo;t kill people, for example. But then Peter Singer pointed out that animals were conscious and that eating them led them to be killed and that wasn&rsquo;t all that morally different from killing people after all. So I became a vegetarian.</p>

<p>Again I thought I was a pretty good person. But then Arianna Huffington told me that by driving in a car I was pouring toxic fumes into the air and sending money to foreign dictatorships. So I got a bike instead.</p>

<p>But then I realized that my bike seat was sewn by children in foreign sweatshops while its tubing was made by mining metals through ripping up the earth. Indeed, any money I spent was likely to go to oppressing people or destroying the planet in one way or another. And if I happen to make money some of it goes to the government which spends it blowing people up in Afghanistan or Iraq.</p>

<p>I thought about just living off of stuff I found in dumpsters, like some friends. That way I wouldn&rsquo;t be responsible for encouraging its production. But then I realized that some people buy the things they can&rsquo;t find in dumpsters; if I got to the dumpster and took something before they did, they might buy it instead.</p>

<p>The solution seemed clear: I&rsquo;d have to go off-the-grid and live in a cave, gathering nuts and berries. I&rsquo;d still probably be exhaling CO2 and using some of the products in the Earth, but probably only in levels that were sustainable.</p>

<p>Perhaps you disagree with me that it&rsquo;s morally wrong to kill animals or blow up people in Afghanistan. But surely you can imagine that it <em>might</em> be, or at least that someone could think it is. And I think it&rsquo;s similarly clear that eating a hamburger or paying taxes contributes &mdash; in a very small way; perhaps only has the possibility of contributing &mdash; to those things.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t, everyday life has a million ways that are more direct. Personally, I think it&rsquo;s wrong that I get to sit at a table and gaily devour while someone else delivers more food to my table and a third person slaves over a stove. Every time I order food, I make them do more carrying and slaving. (Perhaps they get some money in return, but surely they&rsquo;d prefer it if I just gave them the money.) Again, you may not think this wrong but I hope you can admit the possibility. And it&rsquo;s obviously my fault.</p>

<p>Off in the cave, I thought I was safe. But then I read <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/">Peter Singer&rsquo;s latest book</a>. He points out that for as little as a quarter, you can save a child&rsquo;s life. (E.g. for 27 cents you can buy the oral rehydration salts that will save a child from fatal diarrhea.) Perhaps I was killing people after all.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t morally make money, for the reasons described above. (Although maybe it&rsquo;s worth helping fund the bombing of children in Afghanistan in order to help save children in Mozambique.) But instead of living in a cave, I could go to Africa and volunteer my time.</p>

<p>Of course, if I do that there are a thousand other things I&rsquo;m not doing. How can I decide which action I take will save the most lives? Even if I take the time to figuring out, that&rsquo;s time I&rsquo;m spending on myself instead of saving lives.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to be moral. Not only does everything I do cause great harm, but so does everything I don&rsquo;t do. Standard accounts of morality assume that it&rsquo;s difficult, but attainable: don&rsquo;t lie, don&rsquo;t cheat, don&rsquo;t steal. But it seems like living a moral life isn&rsquo;t even possible.</p>

<p>But if morality is unattainable, surely I should simply do the best I can. (Ought implies can, after all.) Peter Singer is a good utilitarian, so perhaps I should try to maximize the good I do for the world. But even this seems like an incredibly onerous standard. I should not just stop eating meat, but animal products altogether. I shouldn&rsquo;t just stop buying factory-farmed food, I should stop buying altogether. I should take things out of dumpsters other people are unlikely to be searching. I should live someplace where others won&rsquo;t be disturbed.</p>

<p>Of course all this worrying and stress is preventing me from doing any good in the world. I can hardly take a step without thinking about who it hurts. So I decide not to worry about the bad I might be doing and just focus on doing good &mdash; screw the rules.</p>

<p>But this doesn&rsquo;t just apply to the rules inspired by Peter Singer. Waiting in line at the checkout counter is keeping me from my life-saving work (and paying will cost me life-saving money) &mdash; better just to shoplift. Lying, cheating, any crime can be similarly justified.</p>

<p>It seems paradoxical: in my quest to do good I&rsquo;ve justified doing all sorts of bad. Nobody questioned me when I went out and ordered a juicy steak, but when I shoplift soda everyone recoils. Is there sense in following their rules or are they just another example of the world&rsquo;s pervasive immorality? Have any philosophers considered this question?</p>
