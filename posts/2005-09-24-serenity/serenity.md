So *Buffy* ran its course, *Angel* got canceled, and *Firefly* saw its
untimely demise. But all is not over for Joss Whedon — *Firefly* is
back, this time in the for of the feature film
*[Serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com/)*. Along with the rest of the
diehard Joss Whedon fans, I’m on the edge of my seat. By all accounts
the film is going to be amazing.

In this time of increasing polarization between left and right
blogospheres, of [endless politically-tinged cultural
crticism](http://alicublog.blogspot.com/), it’s more important to see
some pop culture we can unite behind. That’s why it’s nice to see that
[the leading blogs of the
right](http://instapundit.com/archives/025717.php) and [those of the
left](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_09_18.php#006614)
can get behind this film, with impressive marketing finesse. Here’s how
the film is described:

> Joss Whedon, the Oscar — and Emmy — nominated writer/director
> responsible for the worldwide television phenomena of *Buffy the
> Vampire Slayer*, *Angel*, and *Firefly*, now applies his trademark
> compassion and wit to a small band of galactic outcasts 500 years in
> the future in his feature film directorial debut, Serenity. The film
> centers around Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a hardened veteran (on the
> losing side) of a galactic civil war, who now ekes out a living
> pulling off small crimes and transport-for-hire aboard his ship,
> Serenity. He leads a small, eclectic crew who are the closest thing he
> has left to family — squabbling, insubordinate and undyingly loyal.

I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to have managed to nab two tickets to
a preview screening here in Boston! The place is practically alive with
buzz over this thing — family, friends, random folks at parties are all
talking about it. I’ll be sure to tell you all about how great it was
after I see it.
