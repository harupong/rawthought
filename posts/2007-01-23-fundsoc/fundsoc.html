<p>There are some loons on the Internet trying to spread the idea that the fundamental law of sociology is the black-white test score gap. Put aside the fact that anyone who would even think of proposing such an absurd thing must be a raving scientific racist.</p>

<p>And put aside the fact that they must also be fairly stupid, because such a claim is, at best, a discovery about a particular society, and not a law. (Can you imagine someone claiming that &ldquo;falling objects accelerate at 32 feet per second per second&rdquo; is a fundamental law of physics?)</p>

<p>Even put aside the fact that no actual sociologist would even go near such a claim, as the field&rsquo;s entire purpose is to investigate <em>social</em> causes of such phenomena.</p>

<p>No, let us look at an actual fundamental law of sociology, the Thomas theorem. The Thomas theorem says &ldquo;If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now think about what that means about claiming the black-white test score gap is an immutable law.</p>
