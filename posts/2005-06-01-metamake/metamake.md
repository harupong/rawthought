Just how crazy am I? Well, tonight I wrote my own weblogging system. One
of the silver linings of [losing a
server](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/whaaaa) is that you get to rebuild
things just the way you like.

Anyway, this might mean I’ll start posting more. Or maybe not.

Either way, this site is now proudly powered by good old `make`.

(For those who are interested [the code is now
up](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/code/) but it’s probably not easily
usable by most.)
