<h1>Brought to You by the Letter S</h1>

<p>When you&rsquo;re writing laws, changing the smallest details can have huge effects. But I&rsquo;ve never seen anything as big as what happened this week, when the White House gutted an entire section of financial regulation by removing the letter <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>Right now, shareholders of big companies vote to decide who will be on the board of directors by filling out a mail-in ballot called a proxy card. But currently the corporation&rsquo;s CEO gets to decide who&rsquo;s on the card! The result is a board hand-picked by the CEO &mdash; and they return the favor by providing CEOs with exorbitant salaries.</p>

<p>The current financial regulation bill &mdash; in a provision passed by both the House and Senate &mdash; would change that by allowing shareholders with 5% of the stock to come together and propose additional names for the ballot. But the White House is trying to gut this proposal at the last minute, and they&rsquo;ve done it in an incredibly sneaky way &mdash; they removed the letter <code>s</code> from the end of the word shareholders.</p>

<p>Now instead of shareholders whose stock adds up to 3% coming together, you have to be a single shareholder with 5% of the stock all by yourself. And for most big companies, there just isn&rsquo;t anyone like that. Take GE, for example &mdash; its biggest shareholder only owns about 3.4% of the company.</p>

<p>So by removing a single letter, they managed to make this provision completely useless.</p>

<p>The White House is being barraged by major CEOs begging them to keep fighting for this provision &mdash; after all, no CEO wants to see their lavish salaries cut! As Barney Frank put it, &ldquo;I think there are some people in the White House who think, &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re fighting the financial institutions, but why fight with some of the others, you know, the other corporations?&rsquo;&rdquo; Apparently they&rsquo;re so scared of a fight, they&rsquo;re willing to gut a provision passed by both the House and Senate.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in fighting for real corporate reform, please sign our petition to the White House:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop lobbying against shareholder power in corporate decision-making &mdash; and against protections that would finally rein in CEO pay. That&rsquo;s not change we can believe in.&rdquo;</p>
