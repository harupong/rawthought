<h1>HOWTO: Lose weight</h1>

<p>The standard advice for losing weight is to eat less and exercise.</p>

<p>Exercise is almost worthless as a weight-loss strategy: the number of calories you burn through exercise is miniscule and typically more than made up by your instinct to eat a little extra after exercising. Increased exercise is a <em>consequence</em> of losing weight, not a cause &mdash; when you lose weight you will have more energy and it will be easier to move, so you will then exercise. You have to lose weight first.</p>

<p>That leaves eating less. I have found three strategies to be effective here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Get rid of all snacks.</strong>  It used to be when I was hungry, I&rsquo;d just grab a snack from the kitchen. It got so I basically did this without thinking and, as a result, I ended up eating a lot of snacks. Now the only food I have is unprepared; if I want to eat, I have to consider it and take the time to actually cook something or travel to someplace that sells prepared food.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drink more water.</strong> There are <a href="http://www.shapeupshop.com/weightloss/water-weight-loss.html">lots of reasons</a> to drink more water, but it&rsquo;s also a great way to lose weight. A lot of what feels like hunger is actually thirst, while having water in your stomach seems to counteract certain feelings of hunger. Furthermore, burning fat requires extra water.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to be hungry.</strong> This is no doubt my most controversial tactic, but I do tend to think the body has a &ldquo;set point&rdquo; for the number of calories it&rsquo;s used to consuming. Lowering that set point may mean ignoring a bout of hunger or two and possibly even going a whole day without eating. But after that, your body gets full after eating much less. Again: I&rsquo;m not saying more than a day &mdash; this isn&rsquo;t anorexia &mdash; but a one-day fast is far from unheard of.</p>

<p>This may be easier for me since I almost always eat meals alone, making it no big deal if I skip them. People who eat meals with others may need to get used to only eating a side dish or just nibbling at their order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Losing weight has been better than I ever imagined. Not only am I dramatically thinner, but I have more energy, I waste less time eating, and I now like the way I look. I&rsquo;m much more flexible and mobile and, most incredibly, I&rsquo;ve gotten taller &mdash; this at the age of 23. (A lot of people are skeptical that I&rsquo;ve actually grown taller, but the changes are measurable and dramatic and come with all the symptoms of height growth I remember from my childhood (including the strange urge to stretch vertically on a regular basis). I suppose it&rsquo;s possible the height difference simply results from better posture, but that seems worth counting.)</p>

<p>I do not propose a new diet or some new theory. These are very simple commonsense tips: remove temptation, get enough water, remove obligation. But I&rsquo;ve found they&rsquo;ve been enough for me to lose dramatic amounts of weight. I used to be embarrassingly chubby, now people worry I have anorexia.</p>
