<h1>Wither the Two Cultures?</h1>

<p>Nearly fifty years ago C. P. Snow delivered his famous &ldquo;Two Cultures&rdquo; lecture, deploring the state of affairs in which the humanities, especially those who believed in constructionism, had intellectually diverged from the sciences. Scientists didn&rsquo;t care about Shakespeare; while literists bragged about not knowing any math.</p>

<p>But pick up a modern popular novel and it&rsquo;s hard to see this criticism holding much weight. All the literary outlets have been touting Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s new tome, <em>Against the Day</em>. Pynchon&rsquo;s novels, as eminent literist Scott McLemee put it, discuss &ldquo;the domains of information theory, mathematical physics, cosmology&rdquo; with frequent references to such subjects as &ldquo;William Hamilton&rsquo;s quaternions or Georg Riemann&rsquo;s zeta function&rdquo; in which the Michelson-Morley experiment takes center stage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything but a new Richard Feynman book could do more to warm a scientist&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, take Jonathan Franzen&rsquo;s bestseller, <em>The Corrections</em> (even an Oprah&rsquo;s book club pick!). The book, which revolves around the dot-com economic upturn, not only features frequent and detailed references to eigenvector-based computer algorithms, advances in neurological technology, and odd properties of electrophoresis, but even features a main character who goes from being in that most constructivist of professions &mdash; left-wing literary criticism &mdash; to a job building dot-com websites.</p>

<p>It seems geekiness has gone mainstream. And along with it, the geeky culture of scientism now buts up against the aesthete culture of literism. It&rsquo;s hard to see how anyone can take the two cultures complaints seriously anymore.</p>
