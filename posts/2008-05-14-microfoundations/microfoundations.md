In 1915, Alfred Wegener argued that all the continents of Earth once
used to fit together as one giant supercontinent, which he later named
Pangea. [As Wikipedia
summarizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?oldid=211296230):

> In his work, Wegener presented a large amount of circumstantial
> evidence in support of continental drift, but he was unable to come up
> with a convincing mechanism. Thus, while his ideas attracted a few
> early supporters … the hypothesis was generally met with skepticism.
> The one American edition of Wegener’s work … was received so poorly
> that the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organized a
> symposium specifically in opposition…. … By the 1930s, Wegener’s
> geological work was almost universally dismissed by the scientific
> community and remained obscure for some thirty years.

Today, of course, every schoolchild knows about Pangea. But for a long
time the theory was dismissed, not because it lacked evidence or
predictive power — it explained why the shapes of the continents fit
together, why mountain ranges and coal fields lined up, why similar
fossil were found in places separated by oceans, and so on — but because
Wegener had no plausible mechanism.

A similar problem happens in the social sciences. [Paul Krugman recently
noted](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/bartels-alfred-wegener/)
that while Larry Bartels (in his new book [*Unequal
Democracy*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637)) provides solid,
convincing evidence that Republican presidents systematically preside
over slower growth and increasing inequality, most social scientists
don’t believe him because we haven’t yet identified the mechanisms.
Krugman:

Bartels, for his part, [argues
that](http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m8664.html) providing the
mechanisms isn’t his job — his goal is to highlight the phenomena and
encourage many others to research the mechanisms:

When it comes to addressing such arguments more generally, the most
famous commentator is Jon Elster. In his classic article “[Marxism,
Functionalism, and Game
Theory](http://www.geocities.com/hmelberg/elster/AR82MFGT.HTM)”, he
insists:

> Without a firm knowledge about the mechanisms that operate at the
> individual level, the grand Marxist claims about macrostructures and
> long-term change are condemned to remain at the level of speculation.

(To be fair, Elster doesn’t make this as a general argument, but his
vehemence has led some of his followers to suggest that it is.)

To be clear, I think discovering mechanisms is important work. All I’m
arguing is that it shouldn’t be a necessity for believing in a theory.
Instead, I believe it’s an irrational side-effect of an emotional
distaste for gaps in knowledge.

As evidence, let me note that such demands for mechanisms never go more
than one level deep. Nobody has ever said, “Well, your theory that
people are motivated by greed is all very nice, but I just can’t believe
it until you can explain how greed is manifested in the brain.”
Neuroscience is obviously the microfoundation of psychology, but
psychological theories are regularly accepted without neuroscientific
microfoundations.

In general, it seems like such commentators support a double-standard.
Theories with mechanisms should be judged by their fit with the evidence
and predictive power. Theories without mechanisms should be judged by
the evidence and predictive power and whether you can think of any
plausible mechanisms. I don’t see how this can be justified. There’s no
reason mechanism should be privileged in the assessment of knowledge;
things are true or false, even if we don’t know *why* they are true or
false.

Indeed, it we typically only investigate the causes of phenomena once
we’re convinced that they exist. (Elster admits as much in *Explaining
Social Behavior*, noting that establishing a phenomena’s existence is
the first step towards explaining it.) So let’s stop making the mistake
of not believing things are true because we don’t know how they happen.
