<p>As children we&rsquo;re fed a steady diet of comic books (and now, movies based off of them) in which brave heros save the planet from evil people. It&rsquo;s become practically conventional wisdom that such stories wrongly make the line between good and evil too clear &mdash; the world is more nuanced than that, we&rsquo;re told &mdash; but this isn&rsquo;t actually the problem with these stories. The problem is that the villains <em>know</em> they&rsquo;re evil.</p>

<p>And people really grow up thinking things work this way: evil people intentionally do evil things. But this just doesn&rsquo;t happen. Nobody thinks they&rsquo;re doing evil &mdash; maybe because it&rsquo;s just impossible to be intentionally evil, maybe because it&rsquo;s easier and more effective to convince yourself you&rsquo;re good &mdash; but every major villain had some justification to explain why what they were doing was good. <em>Everybody</em> thinks they&rsquo;re good.</p>

<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, then intentionality doesn&rsquo;t really matter. It&rsquo;s no defense to say (to take a recently famous example) that New York bankers were just doing their jobs, convinced that they were helping the poor or something, because everybody thinks they&rsquo;re just doing their jobs; Eichmann thought he was just doing his job.</p>

<p>Eichmann, of course, is the right example because it was Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s book <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil</em> that is famously cited for this thesis. Eichmann, like almost all terrorists and killers, was by our standards a perfectly normal and healthy guy doing what he thought were perfectly reasonable things.</p>

<p>And if that normal guy could do it, so could we. And while we could argue who&rsquo;s worse &mdash; them or us &mdash; it&rsquo;s a pointless game since its <em>our</em> actions that we&rsquo;re responsible for. And looking around, there&rsquo;s no shortage of monstrous crimes that we&rsquo;ve committed.</p>

<p>So the next time you mention one to someone and they reply &ldquo;yes, but we did with a good intent&rdquo; explain to them that&rsquo;s no defense; the only people who don&rsquo;t are characters in comic books.</p>
