<h1>Why I Won&rsquo;t Use Rimuhosting</h1>

<p>I originally got a VPS at Rimuhosting because their website lauded their &ldquo;fanatical service&rdquo; and a friend had concurred. In September 2006, I ordered my first server.</p>

<p>In December, a friend asked if I knew any good VPS hosts. I said I used Rimuhosting and hadn&rsquo;t had any problems. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;rimuhosting is the company that&rsquo;s just given me horrible support over the last 2 weeks. No answers to email for 2+ days, then a claim that they didn&rsquo;t receive it, then I send them the mail server log that says they should have received it, then they say &lsquo;oh, that&rsquo;s interesting. oh well.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I guess that should have been a sign for me. But instead, he changed his tune: &ldquo;Well, if everyone thinks they&rsquo;re so great, maybe I&rsquo;ll give them another chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The server went down for maintenance three times and was moved to a new IP once. In April 2008, the real trouble started. I was dinged for bandwidth overruns, apparently because Yahoo! was crawling the same files on my server hundreds of times a day. In June, they complained I was monopolizing the CPU, even though when I logged in the machine was 100% idle. They complained again in October and November and December and offered to take a look at the problem if I gave them root on the box. &ldquo;Over my dead body,&rdquo; I thought.</p>

<p>In December they set a CPU cap on my VPS. Then came the amazing bit. Despite already having sold me a VPS and put a CPU cap on my usage of it, they manually edited my partition to add their SSH key to my <code>authorized_keys</code>, used that to <strong>gain root on my box</strong>, noticed that a CGI script was using up CPU, and responded by <strong>turning off Apache</strong>. They didn&rsquo;t even try to call me to talk about it in advance. They didn&rsquo;t even call me at all. They just sent a little email. After the fact. The subject? &ldquo;index.cgi is causing high CPU usage&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked them what was going on. Here was their reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our welcome email we do mention that we have installed our key on your server.</p>
  
  <p>We use that to help our customers.  You are able to remove that if you are not comfortable with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I did remove it. They used their control of the hardware to add it back in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We work to ensure that customer&rsquo;s get a fair share of the CPU, and that their servers perform well.</p>
  
  <p>If everyone is trying to max out the CPU then everyone&rsquo;s performance will be poor.  We can set it so that you get a fixed amount of CPU (and then we don&rsquo;t mind how much CPU want to use).  Or we can let your CPU burst up to 100% of a host server CPU core, in which case your server will run fast, but in which case we&rsquo;d need to make sure you do not monopolize the CPU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, they can break into my box and turn off my webserver. Oddly they don&rsquo;t mention that last option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you think we can help in any other way, e.g. investigating that script or anything, just let us know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose this is the service Rimuhosting is known for. I won&rsquo;t be taking advantage of it again.</p>
