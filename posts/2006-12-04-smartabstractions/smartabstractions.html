<h1>The Genius is in the Details</h1>

<p>As best as we can tell, the human brain works by mastering a specific thing and then &ldquo;giving it a name&rdquo;, wrapping the whole thing up into a bundle and pushing it down a level, so that things can then be built with it as a component. You see this all over the place &mdash; it&rsquo;s how science works, it&rsquo;s how you program, it&rsquo;s even how people deal with their friends (&ldquo;let&rsquo;s do the mall again&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So it would seem natural to think that smart people would work on a very high level, dealing not in details but in huge abstractions. They would have turned everything into a component, no longer worrying about its details, and built things out of the results.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, this seems entirely untrue. The smartest people I know disdain abstractions, preferring to speak in concrete specifics. Take Paul Buchheit, the genius behind Gmail. When he talks about building web applications, he doesn&rsquo;t think about high-level things like the underlying semantic structure of the data &mdash; instead he talks about the little &ldquo;heads&rdquo; that read data off of the hard disk and how fast they can move.</p>

<p>Another friend, also incredibly bright, doesn&rsquo;t refer to other people that way. He doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;oh, he&rsquo;s an expert in X&rdquo; or &ldquo;he&rsquo;s really smart about X&rdquo;; instead he says &ldquo;he&rsquo;s thought a lot about X&rdquo; &mdash; breaking down the abstractions of expertise and intelligence into something much more concrete: spending time thinking about something.</p>

<p>At first glance these seem like mistakes. Why should a brilliant web app programmer be thinking about hard disk heads? Isn&rsquo;t that something someone else should take care of? And why is my smart friend only concerned with how much time someone has spent on something? Aren&rsquo;t there other factors involved?</p>

<p>But if you look the other direction, you see the same pattern. Clueless business guys love speaking in big abstractions, talking about &ldquo;information superhighways&rdquo; that act as &ldquo;more efficient content delivery systems&rdquo; that will &ldquo;monetize the genre&rdquo; by &ldquo;disintermediating the legacy players&rdquo;. These guys are speaking exactly as you would expect smart people to &mdash; thinking at a high level, working with the big ideas &mdash; yet the things they say are so incredibly stupid that they either don&rsquo;t mean anything or mean something that&rsquo;s actually impossible.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here? As we noted at the beginning, the brain works by mastering the details and <em>then</em> giving them a name. But the business guys took the easy way out: they just mastered the names. If you asked them exactly how a content delivery system worked, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you. They know only the high-level thing, with none of the details.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s the details that make it so interesting &mdash; and so powerful. Anyone can master the names of big concepts and combine them like so many puzzle pieces; it&rsquo;s knowing how they work that takes time. And the smart people have made that investment. So perhaps it&rsquo;s just natural that they want to stay it a little closer to it than most.</p>
