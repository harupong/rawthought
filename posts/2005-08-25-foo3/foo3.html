<p>I was recently excited to be invited to FOO camp, where all the leading figures of the modern technology industry shared their deep thoughts with me. Having already started a successful startup, I decided this year it was time to give back to the community, so I did some one-on-one consulting with future entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of me listening to a pitch from up-and-comer Ada Norton about the layer architecture of her new Fish-on-Puppies web application framework. Definitely one to watch &mdash; I&rsquo;ve recommended that Y Combinator invest immediately.</p>

<p>I generously gave <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dailyada/">Ada</a> a 20% discount off my normal consulting fees, in exchange for 10% of the company. I hope that other entrepreneurs will follow my lead in generously giving back to the community.</p>
