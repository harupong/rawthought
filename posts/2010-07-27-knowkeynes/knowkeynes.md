From the left, [Matt Yglesias
writes](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/stimulus-and-the-welfare-state/):

Neither of these are true at all. Pretty much the very first thing
Keynes says in the general theory is that downwardly-inflexible nominal
wage rates (sticky wages) are a *good* thing. And he spends a large part
of chapter 8 denouncing the practice of saving surpluses (sinking
funds).

So where do they get this stuff? While these aren’t the views of Keynes,
both these views are held by the so-called “New Keynesians” — people
like Paul Krugman and Greg Mankiw, who have tried to shoehorn a moderate
version of Keynes into classical economics. These proponents are rather
more prominent than more traditional Keynesians like Jamie Galbraith, so
political commentators hear their view and assume it’s a faithful
representation of Keynes’ own.

Perhaps Keynes was wrong — after all, we shouldn’t slavishly follow the
scribblings of some defunct economist. But if so, we should tell the
truth and admit we’re disagreeing with Keynes, not expounding his ideas.
(Both Yglesias and Becker have not run a correction, despite my emails.)
Furthermore, we should actually engage with Keynes’ argument.

On sticky wages, Keynes says that if nominal wages could fall, then
nominal costs would fall, which would mean that nominal prices would
fall, which means that real wages would end up staying the
same.^[1](#fn:q1)^ But, even worse, if there was no stickiness at all,
nothing would stop nominal wages from falling further and further until
eventually everyone was paid zero.^[2](#fn:q2)^ I have never heard the
New Keynesians respond to this argument.

On the question of surpluses, Keynes criticizes them as a pointless
reduction of aggregate demand. They create unemployment because they
take money out of circulation for no real purpose. It’s just supposed to
sit around until a “rainy day” when the economy isn’t doing so well. But
when that rainy day comes, the reason the economy isn’t doing well is
because people are out of work. If that’s true, you can simply print
more money to get them back to work without any ill effects. (Printing
money only causes inflation at full employment.) You don’t get any
benefit from having taken the money out of circulation
earlier.^[3](#fn:q3)^

Both these seem like strong arguments to me. Perhaps that’s why it’s
easier to pretend they don’t exist.
