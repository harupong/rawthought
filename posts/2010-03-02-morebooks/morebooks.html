<h1>HOWTO: Read more books</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2009">a hundred books a year</a> for the past couple years. Last time I mentioned this, a couple people asked how I could read so many books. Do I read unusually quickly? Do I spend an unusual amount of time reading? I did a simple calculation: The average person spends 1704 hours a year watching TV. If the average reading rate is 250 words per minute and the average book is 180,000 words, then that&rsquo;s 142 books a year. To my surprise, I wasn&rsquo;t reading nearly enough books. So I&rsquo;ve taken some steps to read more:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Block your favorite blogs.</strong> I definitely have the mental habit <a href="http://xkcd.com/477/">noted in this xkcd cartoon</a>: at the first sign of mental difficulty, I tab to a different window and begin typing the URL of a favorite blog. This habit is purely automatic, I do it without even thinking about it. As a result, I spend many, many hours a day reading blogs and following their links.</p>

<p>To overcome this habit, I added all my favorite blogs to an <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that redirects them to a bogus IP. Now when I type their URLs, I get an error message. I did the same with Hulu and other sites I use to watch TV shows; if you have a real television, be sure to get rid of it too. Now I usually try visiting a couple different blogs before my conscious self realizes what&rsquo;s happening, but this happens soon enough and, over the past couple weeks, I&rsquo;ve managed to pretty much train myself out of this bad habit.</p>

<p>Now I either focus on the problem at hand or think enough about it to take a break and go for a walk, eat something, drink some water, read a book, or take a nap.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Order lots of books at the library.</strong> Most people think the way you read more books is by spending more time reading. But I&rsquo;ve found that, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/loseweight">like exercise</a>, this is an effect and not a cause. I spend time reading when I have a great book to read. When I don&rsquo;t, I feel no urge to read and when I do start reading something, I put it down quickly. But if I&rsquo;m reading a great book, I spontaneously come up with times and places to read it.</p>

<p>But figuring out which books are great in advance is hard. People&rsquo;s experiences about which books they find compelling depend somewhat on their interests and finding accurate critics is problematic. So the best way I&rsquo;ve found to see whether a book is good is to just start reading it.</p>

<p>My local library system (<a href="http://www.mln.lib.ma.us/">Minuteman</a>) allows you to request up to 20 books online and then delivers them to the branch library nearest you. So whenever someone makes a book recommendation or I hear about a book that seems interesting, I request it online. Then I go and pick up a stack of books at the library every week or so.</p>

<p>I begin reading them and finish the ones that are exciting enough to finish and return the ones that are unpromising enough to give up on. Then I return them all and get some more.</p>

<p>I also find that the due dates and the growing pile of books provides additional impetus to read them. And the habit doesn&rsquo;t cost me any money this way, so I don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it. (I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with reasons I should feel guilty, but the fact remains that I don&rsquo;t.)</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Alienate everyone close to you.</strong> The biggest consumer of time is undoubtedly other people, in large measure because talking to other people is so fun that you don&rsquo;t notice time going by. By keeping yourself away from other people (living alone is a good start), you free up an enormous amount of time for reading. I find this is particularly useful in reading books, since books can usually substitute for human company: you can take them with you on the train and to meals and curl up with them at night and so on.</p>

<p>Getting rid of other hobbies no doubt also helps. (And, unlike people, books don&rsquo;t encourage you to have other hobbies.) I didn&rsquo;t have any other hobbies, so this was less of a problem for me, but you may want to think about the things you do instead of reading books and stop doing them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keep the temperature low.</strong> A common problem is falling asleep while reading. But I find it&rsquo;s difficult to fall asleep when I&rsquo;m cold (whereas it&rsquo;s very easy to sleep when I&rsquo;m warm), so I keep the temperature quite low in my apartment during the day. Even when I&rsquo;m snuggled up in bed, I&rsquo;m usually cold enough that I can&rsquo;t fall asleep.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect few people will take all of this advice, but hopefully some of it is useful to you.</p>
