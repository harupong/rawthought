<h1>Why I Am Not Gay</h1>

<p>Until recently, men having sex with men was disapproved of in American culture. Actually, &ldquo;disapproved of&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really the right word &mdash; it was immoral, illegal, disgusting. People who did it lived in secrecy, under the constant threat of blackmail for their actions.</p>

<p>In the tumult of the 1960s, various out-groups &mdash; blacks, Chicanos, Native Americans &mdash; begun organizing themselves and demanding to be respected and given their due. And men-who-had-sex-with-men decided that they were an out-group &mdash; they were gay &mdash; and they deserved rights too.</p>

<p>In doing so, they transformed an action (having relationships with someone of the same gender) into an identity (&ldquo;being gay&rdquo;). And, using the normal human mechanisms for distinguishing between people in your club and those not in it, they closed ranks. Gay men didn&rsquo;t have sex with women. Those who did weren&rsquo;t gay, they were &ldquo;bi&rdquo; (which became a whole new identity in itself) &mdash; or probably just lying to themselves. And straight men had to be on constant guard against being attracted to other men &mdash; if they were, it meant that deep down, they were actually gay.</p>

<p>This new gay identity was projected back through history &mdash; famous historical figures were &ldquo;outed&rdquo; as gay, because they&rsquo;d once taken lovers of their own gender. They truly were gay underneath, it was said &mdash; it was just a homophobic society that forced them to appear to like the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Along with the identity went an attempt at justification. Being gay wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;a choice,&rdquo; they argued &mdash; it was innate. Some people were just born gay and others weren&rsquo;t. To a culture that tried to &ldquo;correct&rdquo; gay people into being straight, they insisted that correction was impossible &mdash; they just weren&rsquo;t wired this way. (They even provided a ridiculous genetic explanation for how a species with a small percentage gay people might evolve.)</p>

<p>This might have been a good thing to say &mdash; maybe even necessary in such a homophobic culture &mdash; but in the end it has to be seen as simply wrong. Having sex with other people of your gender isn&rsquo;t an identity, it&rsquo;s an act. And, like sex in general among consenting adults, people should be able to do it if they want to. Having sex with someone shouldn&rsquo;t require an identity crisis. (Nobody sees having-sex-with-white-people as part of their identity, even if that&rsquo;s primarily who they&rsquo;re attracted to.)</p>

<p>People shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to categorize themselves as &ldquo;gay,&rdquo; &ldquo;straight,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bi.&rdquo; People are just people. Maybe you&rsquo;re mostly attracted to men. Maybe you&rsquo;re mostly attracted to women. Maybe you&rsquo;re attracted to everyone. These are historical claims &mdash; not future predictions. If we truly want to expand the scope of human freedom, we should encourage people to date who they want; not just provide more categorical boxes for them to slot themselves into. A man who has mostly dated men should be just as welcome to date women as a woman who&rsquo;s mostly dated men.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not gay. I hook up with people. I enjoy it. Sometimes they&rsquo;re men, sometimes they&rsquo;re women. I don&rsquo;t see why it needs to be any more complicated than that.</p>
