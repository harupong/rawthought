Revolutions on the Internet
===========================

I hate to wade into such a sterile debate as whether social media helps
revolutions, but I made a point about it recently at a conference and
people seemed to like it, so I thought I’d put it up here for posterity.

Jon Elster has a four-phase theory of revolutions:^[1](#fn:fn1)^

1.  A hard-core of committed activists get together to do something
    completely crazy.

2.  The regime cracks down, attracting people who are sympathetic to the
    cause to rally to the support of the crazy ones.

3.  As the protests grow, it seems like they might have a reasonable
    chance of succeeding and it seems worth it even for just normal
    reasonable people to start joining in.

4.  The protests become so overwhelmingly large that even their
    opponents pretend to be part of them, so as not to be on the wrong
    side of history.

It seems pretty clear that the Internet helps with 1 — after all, it’s
brought together groups of crazy committed people about every other
topic, from *Smallville* slash fiction to high-energy astrophysics. It’d
be very surprising if it didn’t bring committed activists together too.

It’s clearly helped with 2 — YouTube videos of protestors being
mistreated by police have been a staple of the \#occupy movement, even
though they haven’t gotten much coverage on traditional TV; We are all
Khaled Said presumably reached some people in Egypt.

3 and 4 are when the cable news and satellite television stations start
joining in and when people support the protest just because it’s such a
huge physical presence in their lives. Here, I agree, the Internet
probably has less effect.

The problem is that you never get to 3 and 4 without 1 and 2 — I don’t
think it’s a total accident that all of these protests are happening
now. I think they’re happening because 1 and 2 have been made much
easier thanks to the Internet. It’s just that most people don’t hear
about them until steps 3 and 4, which are carried much more by
traditional media. They suffer from the understandable fallacy that just
because they heard about it on TV, that must be how everyone else did.
