<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting little experiment you can do. If you have a classroom of kids and you give them a bunch of tasks they can work on of varying difficulty, the kids will pick the tasks that are just outside their level, that stretch them to do a little bit more. (This is, of course, if they aren&rsquo;t getting graded on this. If they&rsquo;re getting graded, they&rsquo;ll always pick the easy ones.)</p>

<p>When I first heard about this experiment, I just assumed it was because they were good kids. But now I think there&rsquo;s a different explanation. It&rsquo;s because doing this is fun.</p>

<p>Working on something that&rsquo;s too easy for you isn&rsquo;t enjoyable, it&rsquo;s just mindless. (There&rsquo;s a reason few people play <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/50K_Racewalker">50K Racewalker</a>.) But doing something that&rsquo;s too hard for you isn&rsquo;t fun either. It&rsquo;s just like trying to run through a wall: you&rsquo;re not going to succeed and you&rsquo;re not going to learn much from it. So, like Goldilocks, the kids pick the task that&rsquo;s just right.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not simply by default either. There&rsquo;s something actively enjoyable in itself about learning to achieve more. (I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/easywayout">come to call this</a> the &ldquo;Kipper effect&rdquo;, after the novel Kipper&rsquo;s Game which revolves around this idea.) There&rsquo;s a definite high to achievement, the rush of accomplishment, just as there&rsquo;s a corresponding low when you fail.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for more research on this idea &mdash; and I&rsquo;d be very grateful if anyone could point me to it. What kinds of things trigger the Kipper effect? Does it wear off? etc.</p>
