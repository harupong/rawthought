How do you expect an advanced textbook on Microeconomics to begin?
Probably not like this:

> Like the overnight train that left me in an empty field some distance
> from the settlement, the process of economic development has for the
> most part bypassed the two hundred or so families that make up the
> village of Palanpur. They have remained poor, even by Indian
> standards: less than a third of the adults are literate, and most have
> endured the loss of a child to malnutrition or to illnesses that are
> long forgotten in other parts of the world. But for the occasional
> wristwatch, bicycle, or irrigation pump, Palanpur appears to be a
> timeless backwater, untouched by India’s cutting edge software
> industry and booming agricultural regions. Seeking to understand why,
> I approached a sharecropper and his three daughters weeding a small
> plot. The conversation eventually turned to the fact that Palanpur
> farmers sow their winter crops several weeks after the date at which
> yields would be maximized. The farmers do not doubt that earlier
> planting would give them larger harvests, but no one the farmer
> explained, is willing to be the first to plant, as the seeds on any
> lone plot would be quickly eaten by birds. I asked if a large group of
> farmers, perhaps relatives, had ever agreed to sow earlier, all
> planting on the same day to minimize losses. “If we knew how to do
> that,” he said, looking up from his hoe at me, “we would not be poor.”

That’s from Samuel Bowles’ unorthodox economics textbook,
*Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution*. We were talking
about it over in the comments on [Crooked
Timber](http://crookedtimber.org/) and one thing led to another and
we’ve decided to start a reading group to go through it.

review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SC7AO6623A1Y/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm):

> …all the relevant issues are presented in their complexity, nothing is
> swept under the carpet, and what makes this book in particular
> commendable is the way in which information from anthropology,
> psychology and the social sciences is weaven into the ‘story’. The
> contrast with the ridiculous assumptions and the unrealistic or simply
> false simplistic models of standard neoclassical textbooks (like for
> example that of Mankiw) is striking. [The difficulty] is mitigated
> somewhat by Bowles’ clear writing, and sometimes he also takes the
> trouble (which unfortunately few economists do) of specifically
> explaining what the mathematical formulas mean, for people who have
> difficulty with somewhat advanced equations and the like. In any case,
> he relies quite correctly more on empirical arguments regarding
> problems of the common, of evolution of institutions, the workings of
> altruism, prisoner’s dilemmas, and so on than on any kind of math
> (although these things can be expressed in math, often).
