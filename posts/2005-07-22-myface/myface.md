In his book [*Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American
Democracy*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679758569/coolbooks02/)
(a relatively moderate book, despite the title) James Fallows asks (p.
94):

> Why do [journalists] want to appear [on TV], when so many reporters
> make fun of the shows? … The most immediate payoff is the simple
> thrill of being noticed and known. Political-journalistic Washington
> functions much like a big high school, with cliques of the popular
> kids, the nerds, the rebels, the left-outs, and so on. To be on Tv is
> to become very quickly a cool kid. Friends call to say they’ve seen
> you. People recognize you in stores. Whether people agree or disagree
> with what you said (or whether they even remember), they treat you as
> “realer” and bigger than you were before.

I learned this weekend that I narrowly missed being on TV (CBS left me
on the cutting room floor — I knew wearing that *Democracy Now!* shirt
was pushing it) but I realized that as a prominent online journalist and
a new (media) online magazine I should try to capitalize on my existing
media power. So I’ve posted a photo on the sidebar, so that if any of my
many millions of readers happen to notice me on the street or in the
shop, they can behave as Fallows suggests:

> [One] hears from friends and relatives for weeks afterward, “I saw you
> on TV!” [Regular commentators] have that extra, sizzling experience of
> seeing strangers’ heads flip back, for a second look (“Is it really
> him?”) as they walk into restaurants or through airport corridors.

Of course, TV does have one big difference:

> In each case the recognition is almost entirely judgment-free … Print
> forces the reader’s attention past your personality to whatever your
> article is trying to say. TV’s effect is mainly to make you bigger
> than life. For each hundred acquaintances who will say, “I saw you on
> the show,” only one will say, “I agree [or disagree] with what you
> said.”

So, uh, if you happen to see me in a movie theater, or on an airplane,
or in the bathroom, or in your dorm room, don’t hesitate to shout, ‘HEY!
It’s Aaron Swartz! I saw you on the weblog.’ Here, I’ll help you out
with another picture:

Heh, I almost put a picture of Blake Ross there. You would have fallen
for that wouldn’t you!
