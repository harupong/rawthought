<h1>That Vision Thing</h1>

<p>Ironically enough, I remember the moment clearly. It was about five
years ago now, when I looked up from the car and realized I couldn&rsquo;t
see. I had been staring at my computer a lot, and reading books when I
wasn&rsquo;t doing that, so I didn&rsquo;t notice much, but that day, riding in the
car, I looked up and realized I couldn&rsquo;t read the street sign. I
definitely used to be able to read that sign, but there it was, big and
bright and green along the highway, and all I could make out was a blur.
I had gone blind.</p>

<p>Legally blind, as I learned yesterday. My vision is below the legal
threshold in the US for legal blindness. (Far below, as far as I can
tell, but the eye exam chart doesn&rsquo;t really make fine-grained
distinctions at that level.) And yet, for five years, this never really
bothered me. I never wore glasses for more than an hour, I squinted hard
enough to pass the vision test at the DMV, I sat close to blackboards
and listened carefully.</p>

<p>I tried a couple things to improve my eyesight, but nothing very
seriously. I tried, but it never seemed important enough to warrant the
effort. And so I walked thru life, legally blind. I didn&rsquo;t really
notice.</p>

<p>My roommate, Quinn, has been nagging me about this. She wants me to get
LASIK, I think largely because it involves lasers. But finally the other
day I took some action and went to the optometrist.</p>

<p>You know those eye charts you see sometimes? The ones that famously
start with E at the top and then the letters get smaller and smaller? I
couldn&rsquo;t read the E. When I looked up at it, all I saw was a vague blur.
So they gave me contacts.</p>

<p>Contacts are an odd thing. They&rsquo;re almost invisible, malleable little
things that you can&rsquo;t see once they&rsquo;re stuck on your eye. One minute,
you&rsquo;re living a Monet-like existence of a world blurred, then tap your
eye and suddenly, invisibly, everything is clear.</p>

<p>I had no idea the world really looked like this, with such infinite
clarity. It looks like a modernist photo or a hyperreal film, everything
in focus everywhere. Everyone kept saying &ldquo;oh, do you see the leaves
now?&rdquo; but the first thing I saw was not the leaves but the people.
People, individuated, each with brilliant faces and expressions at
gaits, the sun streaming down upon them. I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. It&rsquo;s
much harder being a misanthrope when you can see people&rsquo;s faces.</p>

<p>Then came the signs, the signs with messages I could read from a
distance. No longer would I have to carefully count my stops on the
subway because I couldn&rsquo;t read the station signs. And then the
buildings, their edges no longer fuzzy like clouds but hard and harsh
and magnificent.</p>

<p>I no longer feared myself, formerly this vague visage in the mirror that
I had to look away from. Now in the mirror I could see my face, and even
thought it looked good.</p>

<p>The resolution on my cameraphone suddenly seems insufficient. The crumbs
and dirt in our apartment that previously drove my roommate crazy are
now visible enough to drive me crazy too. I can look people in the eye
and smile and see them smile back. I can see the contours of their
faces. When I look up at night I can see the things in my room, even
when the lights are off.</p>

<p>My eyes are open and I can now experience the beauty that&rsquo;s been more
than a few feet in front of my nose.</p>
