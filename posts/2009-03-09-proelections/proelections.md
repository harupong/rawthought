In Defense of Elections

Traditional left-wing thought treats elections as epiphenomenal: build a
strong enough social movement and politicians will be forced to do what
you want. In this view, it doesn’t really matter who gets elected since
they’re ultimately all subject to the same structural forces. Working to
get someone “good” elected is really just a waste of time, since they’ll
turn out to be as bad as all the others once they get into office.

(Think Noam Chomsky’s comments about the unimportance of electoral
politics, or the Alinskyite theory that one should try to cultivate an
attitude of “fear and loathing” among politicians.)

There’s clearly a great deal of truth to this — structural forces are
ultimately very powerful. But I think it misses a great deal as well.
This model assumes politicians are this separate class of rational
actors who respond purely to electoral incentives; if your grassroots
movement gets them votes, they’ll help you out, but they’re just as
happy to sell you out to a higher bidder.

But what if the politicians involved are actually activists themselves?
What if the choice isn’t between joining a electoral campaign and
joining an issue campaign, but between starting a electoral campaign and
starting an issue campaign? Here I think the calculus changes wildly.

For one thing, just at the campaign level, electoral campaigns have a
lot of advantage over issue campaigns. They fit into a designated “news
hole” so it’s easier for the media to cover them, they have clear
deadlines which spur people to action, and there’s a clear existing
model for how to do them (including fundraising, scheduling, volunteer
management, etc.).

Furthermore, if you actually win, you can now continue the campaign from
a much stronger institutional base: you’ll have a full-time salaried
staff, your pronouncements will be *de facto* news, and there will be
strong social pressure preventing the whole thing from fizzling out as
people decide to do other things with their lives.

Of course, there’s also the positive impact you can make as an
officeholder. Obviously you’ll be able to help institutionalize your
goals by passing laws and regulations you support (just as you would try
to push as an outsider), but you’ll also be able to promote things in
innumerable smaller ways, just by meeting with other politicians and
using the influence of your office. Take this story from Matt Taibbi
about Bernie Sanders, the socialist Senator from Vermont:

> [He] kept coming back to a story about his very first meeting with the
> Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. At the meeting, the

> he went and had a word with Kennedy after the meeting.
>
> “The end result is that we got a 6 percent increase, instead of a 4

Obviously there are few offices as powerful as United States Senator,
but every job has opportunities for simple victories like these, if at a
much smaller scale. Sure, outside groups can always try to push
officials to do things like this, but if you actually are the elected
official you can just do them. (Plus, how often do outside groups know
about these simple things?)

The late Senator Paul Wellstone, who came to electoral politics from
grassroots organizing himself, argued that political change had three
parts: the intellectual work of discovering what’s wrong and how to fix
it (i.e. policy development), the organizing work of mobilizing citizens
into activist groups, and the electoral work of running for office and
getting elected. And it seems that the left seems to neglect the last of
these.

For a young leftist, a career in academia or the think tanks is an easy
choice, while those who are bolder go into full-time activism. But
running for office never seems like a viable option. (When people ask
Noam Chomsky how they can fix things, he never says they should run for
office.) (We’ll ignore for a moment the delusion the left seems to have
that they should run for office as a third-party in a two-party system.)
The result is a severe deficit of genuine leftist candidates. Which of
course feeds their sense that politicians are just going to sell you
out.

Leftists need to think more about running for office. Not as an
alternative to advocacy or activism, but as an extension of it.
Campaigns are an incredible opportunity to explain and fight for the
issues you believe in, while elected offices are a great opportunity to
achieve them. That’s how [the left took Santa
Cruz](http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/santacruz/progressive_politics.html),
probably the only real city in the country with a leftist government,
and that’s how they’ll take the country.
