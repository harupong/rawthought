Science, we imagine, is the realm of objective disinterested geniuses
reporting back the findings from their expensive equipment, telling us
truths about the world. Politics, on the other hand, is seen as the
place for sleazy and corrupt jerks who lie to us in everything they do
and try to make everything fit their existing worldviews. So is it any
surprise that when the two things meet we’re in for a show?

Journalist Chris Mooney has made a name for himself by writing magazine
articles that make this intersection, especially under the Bush
administration, entertaining. He’s recently released his first book,
*The Republican War on Science*, which tries to combine the various
individual stories into a damning case of science politicization. The
book tackles a variety of subjects, including:

-   global warming
-   nutrition guidelines
-   fishing regulations
-   evolution
-   embryonic stem cells
-   safe sex

Each one gets a chapter written in the style of a magazine article
(indeed, many have been published as magazine articles), opening with an
interesting person or event and expanding to show how a group of Bush
backers (drawn from major industry and the religious right) have
concocted their own psuedoscience in an attempt to spread confusion
about the truth, with a particular focus on its effects in Washington,
where Mooney is based. Mooney bookends these stories with some more
general thoughts about the relations of conservatives and science.

The book has been something of a surprise success, recently making it
onto the *New York Times* bestseller list, and Mooney has been busy
doing a book tour for it. I went to see him when he spoke just down the
street at Porter Square Books and talked to him a bit afterwards as he
signed my copy. The audience was interested and engaged. I suspect a lot
of it was typical anger at the Bush administration (or “the neocon
radicals up in Washington and the media” as the angry sort who call in
to radio shows and so on always seem to put it), but I think this
particular issue strikes at the heart of people’s dislike for the
administration: the administration refuses to go along with reality,
even in its most pure form.

The book itself is a respectable and highly readable (I went through it
in a day’s free time) piece of work, although I could not help but feel
a little disappointed. In an apparent attempt to gain respectability,
Mooney adopts a detached journalistic — almost legalistic — style. While
Mooney doesn’t pull any punches factually — he will call a lie a lie and
refuses to be pulled into the trap of equating conservative science
abuses with liberal ones — such a style lacks the verve of Mooney’s more
strident online writing, such as when he wrote about Michael Crichton’s
global warming denialist novel *State of Fear*:

> Let’s face it: Such writing is pure porn for global warming deniers,
> in much the same way that fictional accounts of UFO abduction skeptics
> converting into true believers titillate UFO fans. […] By the book’s
> end, one can only ask: What planet is Michael Crichton living on?
> Because this one is clearly getting warmer.
> ([cite](http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/crichton/))

By comparison, Mooney’s book-long exposé of numerous indidents of Bush
administration distortion and dishonesty concludes more like this:

> these considerations all suggest science politicization has reached a
> nadir with the Bush administration […] Considered this way, Bush
> administration abuses and distortions of science come to look more and
> more like a large-scale political strategy. (241f)

And despite Mooney’s attempts at moderation and fairness, he hasn’t won
any favors from the press. *Publishers Weekly*, in a favorable review,
called it “very readable, and understandably partisan” while the
*Washington Post* attacked it as “surprisingly unconvincing”,
“polemic[al]”, and “a kind of conspiracy theory”. Since the mainstream
was apparently ready to consider the book partisan no matter the style,
Mooney probably would have been better off writing a little more
strongly.

But what about conservative readers? At the book signing, someone asked
Mooney if he thought the book would reach them. Mooney doubted that any
of the relevant politicians would actually read it. ‘But, you know,
maybe someone will say to them, “Things have gotten so bad that there’s
now a book claiming we’re at war with science!”’ he said. ‘Maybe that
will have some effect.’
