For years, I’ve wanted to be on public radio. As a kid, we used to hear
the voices of Garrison Keillor and Ira Glass and even Carl Kasell, while
our parents drove us around in the stationwagon. As I grew older, I came
to respect radio as a particularly unique medium for explaining things
to people; a skill, like writing, that I wished to develop.

I’ve had a few desultory attempts, but I finally had a good excuse to
get my act together. Public broadcasting people are sponsoring a [Public
Radio Talent Quest](http://www.publicradioquest.com/) and I’ve decided
to submit an entry. My idea was to make a radio show about science that
matters.

[Here’s my first attempt](http://www.publicradioquest.com/node/1484).
(You can listen and vote for me on the contest’s website.)

For those who don’t love the magic of radio, a transcript follows:

> It’s 1958 and you’re sitting on a table with your shirt off. You
> signed up for an experiment on vitamins improving vision and now
> someone’s plunging a needle into your arm. Ow! Since when do vitamins
> require needles anyway?
>
> *[music: Waltz (Better Than Fine) - Fiona Apple]*
>
> Now the man is gone and you’re waiting for the experiment to start.
> There’s another kid here too. You both look pretty bored. Then the
> other kid starts goofing off. Doodling, making paper airplanes, that
> sort of thing. And then you feel it.
>
> *[TAP tap tap…]*
>
> Your hands begin to shake. Your heart starts to pound. Your face
> begins to feel flushed.
>
> *[…tap tap TAP.]*
>
> Boy, goofing off sure looks like fun. So you join in.
>
> * * * * *
>
> So that shot in your arm? The thing is, it’s actually adrenaline.
> Hand-shaking, heart-pounding, face-flushing adrenaline.
>
> Half the kids in the experiment were told the shot might make their
> hearts race. And those kids? They sat quietly, even while the other
> kid in the room with them goofed off. But the rest? The ones, like
> you, who weren’t told? They joined right in.
>
> One kid started throwing wads of paper at passersby. Another grabbed a
> piece of equipment off the wall and used it as a hula-hoop. They just
> felt so *good*, they later explained.
>
> * * * * *
>
> We think of our feelings as unerring: follow your heart, do what makes
> you happy — that sort of thing. But what the adrenaline experiment
> showed is that it’s not so simple. Feelings don’t come with nice,
> clean explanations. Our brain makes a guess. And sometimes it guesses
> wrong.
>
> We’re not the slaves of our emotions. For the kids in the experiment,
> just knowing *why* they were feeling a certain way was enough to
> change their response.
>
> Following your heart can be fun. But it’s also nice to know that you
> don’t have to.
