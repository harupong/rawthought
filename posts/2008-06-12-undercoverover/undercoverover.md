My latest piece for *Extra!* is now up:

[Is Undercover Over?: Disguise seen as deceit by timid
journalists](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3391)

It’s about the rise and fall of undercover journalism. Here’s an
excerpt:

> Undercover reporting has a storied history. Nellie Bly, famous for
> traveling around the world in 80 days, also did a famed investigation
> of the conditions in insane asylums for the New York World. Bly
> feigned insanity for a series of physicians before being committed to
> a lunatic asylum. There she documented rotten and spoiled food,
> freezing living conditions, frigid bathwater, abusive nurses and
> relatively sane fellow residents. “What, excepting torture, would
> produce insanity quicker than this treatment?” she wondered. The
> series, later published as the book Ten Days in a Mad-House, created a
> sensation, and Bly was asked to join a government investigation of
> asylum conditions.
