<p>For the past six months or so, I&rsquo;ve been working on getting data out of government in various ways. At one point, I was looking thru SEC files online and noticed that some portions were redacted. I filed a Freedom of Information request for the redacted portion and any documents pertaining to why it was redacted. It ended up costing $28 and to make sure I get the most for my money, I thought I&rsquo;d share the results with you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Confidential Treatment Requested by General Electric Company</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>1. Please refer to comment 5 of our letter dated August 21, 2007. Please provide a more detailed analysis justifying the omission of  disclosure [&hellip;] that specifically sets fort  the manner in which competitors could use the information to obtain the competitive advantage cited in your response.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>[*** Confidential treatment requested for the paragraphs below:</em></p>
  
  <p>General Electric Company&rsquo;s (&ldquo;GE&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) long-term performance awards program (the &ldquo;LTPA&rdquo;) is based on four equally weighted business measurements, which are: (a) average earnings per share growth rate; (b) average revenue growth rate; (c) cumulative return on total capital; and (d) cumulative cash flow from operating activities. As indicated in the Company&rsquo;s response letter, dated October 10, 2007, these business measurements are used to establish financial goals (the &ldquo;Goals&rdquo;) for the Company over a three-year period and are directly derived from the Company&rsquo;s internal, confidential business plan. Each of the Goals involves confidential information that, if made public, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] For example, upon the announcement of a sizable acquisition, debt investors generally examine the companies ability to fund the acquisition and to service its existing debt and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] will be affected by the acquisition. This point is illustrated by the Company&rsquo;s December 26, 2007 announcement that GE Capital would acquire certain assets and businesses from Merill Lynch Capital. Although immaterial to GE Capital, after the announcement of the acquisition [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] Based on its experience the Company believes that [REDACTED] in the Goals such as [REDACTED] acquisition [REDACTED] like the Merill Lynch Capital acquisition [REDACTED] [REDACTED] The Company believes that disclosing the goals would [REDACTED] [REDACTED] the Goals [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] As a result, the Company&rsquo;s [REDACTED] [REDACTED]</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;] We do not believe that the SEC&rsquo;s executive compensation disclosure rules should cause the disclosure of the Goals simply because the Company&rsquo;s Management Development and Compensation Committee chose to include them in the LTPA. Such disclosure would have the unintended and harmful effect of [REDACTED] [REDACTED]</p>
  
  <p>The Company therefore believes that it would suffer substantial competitive harm if ti had to disclose the Goals because it would [REDACTED] [REDACTED]</p>
  
  <p><em>End of request for confidential treatment ***]</em></p>

<p>Hope that helps. At least the SEC uses white-out instead of black marker.</p>
