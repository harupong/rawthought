![Aaron Swartz used a free trial of the government's Pacer system to
download 19,856,160 pages of documents in a campaign to place the
information free online.](image1_pacer)

Michael Francis McElroy for The New York Times

**Attention attractive people:** Are you looking for someone respectable
enough that they’ve been *personally vetted* by the *New York Times*,
but has enough of *a bad-boy streak* that the vetting was because they
‘liberated’ *millions of dollars* of government documents? If so, look
no further than page A14 of today’s *New York Times*:

> Aaron Swartz, a 22-year-old Stanford dropout and entrepreneur who read
> Mr. Malamuds appeal, managed to download an estimated 20 percent of
> the entire database: 19,856,160 pages of text.
>
> Then on Sept. 29, all of the free servers stopped serving. The
> government, it turns out, was not pleased.
>
> A notice went out from the Government Printing Office that the free
> Pacer pilot program was suspended, pending an evaluation. A couple of
> weeks later, a Government Printing Office official, Richard G. Davis,
> told librarians that the security of the Pacer service was
> compromised. The F.B.I. is conducting an investigation.

blog](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/steal-these-federal-records-okay-not-literally/):

> In the technology world, Mr. Swartz is kind of a big deal, as the
> saying goes. At the age of 14, he had a hand in writing RSS, the
> now-ubiquitous software used to syndicate everything from blog posts
> to news headlines directly to subscribers.
>
> [O]ver the course of six weeks, Mr. Swartz was able to download 780
> gigabytes of data — 19,856,160 pages of text — from Pacer. The caper
> grabbed an estimated 20 percent of the entire PACER network, with a
> focus on the most recent cases from almost every circuit.
>
> When the government abruptly shut down the free public program, Mr.
> Malamud saw it as a sign of possible trouble ahead. “Who shuts down a
> 17-site national program with no notice whatsoever?” he recalled
> thinking. “I immediately saw the potential for overreaction by the
> courts.”
>
> Mr. Malamud told Mr. Swartz: “You need to talk to a lawyer. I need to
> talk to a lawyer.” Mr. Swartz recalled, “I had this vision of the Feds
> crashing down the door, taking everything away.”
>
> He said he locked the deadbolt on his door, lay down on the bed for a
> while, and then called [to warn] his mother.
>
> But when lawyers told Mr. Malamud and Mr. Swartz that they appeared to
> have broken no laws, Mr. Malamud sent Mr. Swartz a message saying,
> “You should just lay low for a while.”
>
> Mr. Swartz said that he waited for a couple of months, but “nobody
> came knocking on my door. I started breathing a little more easily.”
