<p><strong>Attention attractive people:</strong> Are you looking for someone respectable enough that they&rsquo;ve been <em>personally vetted</em> by the <em>New York Times</em>, but has enough of <em>a bad-boy streak</em> that the vetting was because they &lsquo;liberated&rsquo; <em>millions of dollars</em> of government documents? If so, look no further than page A14 of today&rsquo;s <em>New York Times</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aaron Swartz, a 22-year-old Stanford dropout and entrepreneur who read Mr. Malamuds appeal, managed to download an estimated 20 percent of the entire database: 19,856,160 pages of text.</p>
  
  <p>Then on Sept. 29, all of the free servers stopped serving. The government, it turns out, was not pleased.</p>
  
  <p>A notice went out from the Government Printing Office that the free Pacer pilot program was suspended, pending an evaluation. A couple of weeks later, a Government Printing Office official, Richard G. Davis, told librarians that the security of the Pacer service was compromised. The F.B.I. is conducting an investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the technology world, Mr. Swartz is kind of a big deal, as the saying goes. At the age of 14, he had a hand in writing RSS, the now-ubiquitous software used to syndicate everything from blog posts to news headlines directly to subscribers.</p>
  
  <p>[O]ver the course of six weeks, Mr. Swartz was able to download 780 gigabytes of data &mdash; 19,856,160 pages of text &mdash; from Pacer. The caper grabbed an estimated 20 percent of the entire PACER network, with a focus on the most recent cases from almost every circuit.</p>
  
  <p>When the government abruptly shut down the free public program, Mr. Malamud saw it as a sign of possible trouble ahead. &ldquo;Who shuts down a 17-site national program with no notice whatsoever?&rdquo; he recalled thinking. &ldquo;I immediately saw the potential for overreaction by the courts.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Malamud told Mr. Swartz: &ldquo;You need to talk to a lawyer. I need to talk to a lawyer.&rdquo; Mr. Swartz recalled, &ldquo;I had this vision of the Feds crashing down the door, taking everything away.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>He said he locked the deadbolt on his door, lay down on the bed for a while, and then called [to warn] his mother.</p>
  
  <p>But when lawyers told Mr. Malamud and Mr. Swartz that they appeared to have broken no laws, Mr. Malamud sent Mr. Swartz a message saying, &ldquo;You should just lay low for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Swartz said that he waited for a couple of months, but &ldquo;nobody came knocking on my door. I started breathing a little more easily.&rdquo;</p>
