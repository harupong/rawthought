<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

<p>Nobody seems to have noticed, but over the past couple months, this blog has been publishing a record post a day. Every weekday &mdash; plus, starting a little later, a bonus post on sundays &mdash; I&rsquo;ve written an entirely new essay. I&rsquo;ve done this while traveling, while celebrating holidays, while galavanting around the world, while sleeping on the couches of published authors. I&rsquo;ve even written and posted whole pieces using the SSH feature on my cell phone.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone else who has done this. There are columnists who write for the paper, but they only have to post a couple times a week. And there are bloggers who post many times a day, but they mostly post links and commentary, not whole essays. As far as I know, I&rsquo;m alone in this bizarre pursuit.</p>

<p>It was a fun experiment but it was also a lot of work. I still have lots to say, but I&rsquo;m not sure that forcing myself to say it every day is quite so healthy. I want to work on writing better, not just faster. I wrote most of the blog posts in about an hour and while they&rsquo;re decent for something written at that rate, they can rarely be called great.</p>

<p>So I think it&rsquo;s time to slow down, work more on crafting my prose, maybe write for magazines and other outlets. (If someone out there wants to publish me, <a href="mailto:me@aaronsw.com">drop me a line</a>!) This will probably hurt my readership, but running this blog has always been a weird and random occupation, done more for me than for page views.</p>

<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s goodbye for now and thanks for stopping by. If this piece gets posted when it&rsquo;s supposed to, it&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Day and I&rsquo;ve still got a couple more weeks of winter break to spend world-travelling. So expect some silence until I get back. <em>Au revoir!</em></p>
