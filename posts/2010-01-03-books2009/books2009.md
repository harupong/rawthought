* * * * *

Well, it’s time for my annual look back thru the books I read this year.
(Previously: [2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006),
[2007](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007),
[2008](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2008books).) I’ve included links to
reviews, where I have them, and italicized the titles of the books I
recommend without reservation.

1.  The Liberal Hour ([my review: 3
    stars](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKO3K5WR85YB/))
2.  Depression Economics
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WP6BGGG59R3/))
3.  The Great Derangement
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R32I4OZJU4C5UQ/))
4.  Politics the Wellstone Way
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLP4VN68PP0A/))
5.  Who Really Rules? ([5](http://www.amazon.com/review/RD66PCB1QYMH2/))

    ([3](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9UW6NKMWA6J/))
7.  For Common Things
8.  Who Governs?
9.  Supreme: The Story of the Year
    ([2](http://www.amazon.com/review/R11TF84EZX5F0W/))
10. Changing the Powers that Be
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWTNES8RE9XJ/))
11. New Kings of Nonficton
12. On Writing Well ([3](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9RZ7Q6X6BRS/))

    This book is really dreadful, mostly because the author actually
    cannot write well.

13. [*The Power Broker*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394720245)
    ([5](http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOVNQ3JLY6GF/))

    I cannot possibly say enough good things about this book. Go read
    it. Right now. Yes, I know it’s long, but trust me, you’ll wish it
    was longer. I think it may be simply the best nonfiction book.

14. What Are Intellectuals Good For?
15. Priorities in Health
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3312XB4IFMO2R/))
16. Invisible Hands
17. The Option of Urbanism
18. Getting There
19. On Directing Film
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QYA1TV8GOIJ/))

    Not just a great book about directing, but a great book about
    *writing*.

20. The High Cost of Free Parking
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R370YSX27EUSZS/))
21. The Leftmost City
22. Outliers
23. The Hearts of Men ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/RRW8N49XT2TYR/))
24. The Power Elite and the State
    ([3](http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBH5SLNQ9JZQ/))
25. Southern California Country
26. Seeing Like a State
    ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1CTSTZLCNO5/))
27. Traffic
28. Fast Food Nation
29. Building Rules ([2](http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHIL6NUKLFWE/))
30. Urban Fortunes ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R203162R8QOQ3D/))
31. Falling Behind
32. [The Sources of Social Power, Vol.
    2](http://books.theinfo.org/go/052144585X)

    Not an easy book, but Michael Mann continues to amaze.

33. Divided Highways
34. Prisoner’s Dilemma
35. Running After Antelope
36. Cities of Tomorrow
37. Suburb ([4](http://www.amazon.com/review/R171OSWU5ATSOH/))
38. [*The Social Life of Small Urban
    Spaces*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/097063241X)

    If Feynman was a sociologist, this is probably the book he’d write.
    A delightful little thing.

39. Downtown
40. Radical Innocent
41. Suburban Nation
42. Zoned Out
43. [*American Apartheid*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674018214)

    This book is criminally under-publicized. Everyone has their own
    crazy theories about why it is that blacks are disadvantaged in our
    society. Massey and Denton show it’s much more obvious than any of
    that: they’re victims of extreme segregation, with all the negative
    effects that entails. An absolutely brilliant book.

44. Crabgrass Frontier
45. Human Consequences of Urbanism
46. The Essential William H. Whyte
47. Gridlock Economy
48. Barbed Wire: A Political History
49. Market Rebels

54. Bourgeois Nightmares
55. The Zoning of America
56. The Sun Also Rises
57. Bourgeois Utopias
58. Planned Sprawl
59. Block By Block
60. Opus 300
61. [The Path to Power](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679729453)

    After you finish *The Power Broker*, if you want more, read this.

62. Means of Ascent
63. Death at an Early Age
64. A City Transformed
65. Master of the Senate
66. City of Quartz
67. [*The Liberal Defence of
    Murder*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672409)

    This book is like a little miracle. I’m not even sure how to
    describe it, except to say that it turns one’s understanding of
    history completely upside-down.

68. [Categorically Unequal](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871545845)

    If you’re interested in inequality, this little overview is the
    place to start.

69. Side Effects
70. [*The Fox and the Hedgehog*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1566630193)

    Absolutely delightful.

71. The Threat to Reason
72. Plunder and Blunder
73. The Waxman Report
74. Who Rules America? (6th ed.)
75. [Angler](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0143116169)

    Great introduction to how to use “the bureaucracy” and Cheney’s
    utter deviousness.

76. Chief of Staff
77. [Showdown at Gucci Gulch](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0394758110)

    Plato](http://www.reasonandpersuasion.com/)

    Great fun.

92. Two Memoirs (Keynes)
93. *Bat Boy: The Musical*

    If you ever get a chance, go see it. It’s the greatest musical ever.

94. John Maynard Keynes (Skidelsky)
95. Facing Unpleasant Facts
96. [*Bad Samaritans*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002VPE6ZC)

125. Adventures in Cartooning
126. The Composer is Dead
127. Horseradish
128. [*Nemesis*](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0749304650)

    A wonderful book for anyone interested in how science is actually
    done. ([chapter 1](http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/nemch1.htm),
    [chapters 2-4](http://muller.lbl.gov/pages/Nemesis%20Chapters/))

129. Keynes: Return of the Master
130. Chris Ware (Raeburn)
131. [Gaming the Vote](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002SB8OMA)

    Poundstone’s really become an amazing writer. While this isn’t as
    good as *[Fortune’s
    Formula](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990)* it really is quite
    fun. Poundstone takes a rather novel tack in making the argument for
    voting system reform. Instead of saying that it will allow for
    third-parties to get a fair hearing, he argues it will protect the
    major parties from the insidious effect of spoilers.

    Furthermore, instead of IRV, Approval, or even Condorcet voting, he
    endorses Range Voting as the best voting system, arguing against
    Condorcet on some weird grounds about determinant ballots that just
    doesn’t make sense to me (p. 226).

    Both of these seem reasonable when Poundstone lays them out, but are
    totally insane upon further inspection. Voting reform may protect
    against spoilers in the short-term, but in the long term it’ll
    likely doom us to some kind of fractured multiparty system. (That’s
    not to say it’s a bad thing.) And range voting, like its proponents,
    is totally batshit insane. (He even passes on their ridiculous
    claims about it being better than democracy with a straight face.)

    Let’s think about this for a second. Strategic voting with a range
    ballot (which even range voting’s proponents say they’ll do) is
    simply approval voting (plus maybe some meaningless nursery effect —
    if you want that, just have a nonbinding approval box or something).
    So for the system to work, it depends on people voting
    astrategically. But obviously those people’s votes will count less
    than strategic votes. So range voting’s only advantage over approval
    voting is that it counts the votes of naive voters less. How is that
    fair?

    I think the Range Voting comparison with Condorcet is rigged; you’ll
    notice they never provide any explanation for why their supposedly
    strategic Condorcet behavior is actually strategic. And the only
    strategic Condorcet behavior Poundstone provides is trying to create
    a tie to force it into sequential dropping, which seems wildly
    implausible in a real-life scenario. So it still seems Condorcet
    outperforms them all.

132. [If You’re an Egalitarian, How Come You’re So
    Rich?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674006933)

    I really enjoyed this book. It starts with a simple thought
    experiment: imagine you had a long-lost identical twin who grew up
    in a conservative home and became a conservative. You, by contrast,
    grew up in a liberal home and became a liberal. Wouldn’t meeting him
    make you question your beliefs? And thus, shouldn’t the possibility
    that you *could* meet him make you question your beliefs? (I’m not
    totally convinced by this; my beliefs are much more shaken by
    converts — people who were strong believers in X but converted to
    believing in Y.)

    From this, Cohen heads to a reminiscence of his own upbringing,
    which I found especially touching, perhaps because he has the
    identity I wish I had: a Canadian communist in an antireligious
    Yiddish-speaking home. In the middle there’s a good bit on Hegel,
    Marx, and why not to heighten the contradictions, and he concludes
    by refuting Rawls with the same argument Matt Yglesias used on Kent
    Conrad: Rawls says that in a just society, everyone would embrace
    the Difference Principle, but the Difference Principle allows for
    differences because some people will work harder if they get more,
    but if those people embrace the principle then why wouldn’t they
    give their money to the poor and embrace egalitarianism? He ends by
    addressing the title question and accepting a sort of Yglesian
    approach to politics: an overriding concern with the structure of
    political institutions, but also a strong sense of moral demands for
    people to achieve they best they can within existing structures.

    Finally, it got me wondering: a lot of Marx (and, I would add,
    Keynes) thinks about the future as some sort of society where
    industrial products give us abundance and economic laws loosen their
    hold on us. The industrial revolution didn’t do that, but perhaps
    the post-scarcity technological future might?

And my first book of the new year is Daniel Ellsberg’s
*[Secrets](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0142003425)*, which I’m already
loving.
