What is Elitism?

This week’s Sunday Bonus Post [comes from local genius Kragen
Sitaker](http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-October/000831.html).

Upon reading an article that claimed:

> [S]cience is hard. It is therefore inherently “elitist,” merely in
> this obvious sense: as with skateboarding, some will be demonstrably
> better at it than others.

Kragen saw fit to ponder the meaning of elitism. Kragen thinks of
himself as an anti-elitist, but he’s also very pro-science. How to
reconcile the two?

Kragen begins by defining “elite”:

> An “elite” is a small group of people who are distinguished from the
> majority in one of two ways: either they are better in some way, or
> they have more power. These are distinct meanings, although apologists
> for established orders like to conflate them, and sometimes one leads
> to the other. Sometimes an elite is distinguished by the mastery of a
> particular skill, such as skateboarding or mathematics, and sometimes
> by past accomplishments; but the much more common sense of the term
> today is to refer to a group of people who have power.

Elitism, then (according to Kragen) is the ideology that insists that
the elite and non-elite reached their positions through intrinsic merit.
(This belief might also be called meritocracy, but that is perhaps a
less pejorative term.)

Ironically, the very article that begun this investigation appears to
believe in this ideology. The article claims that textbooks, in trying
to be “democratic”, lower their standards so that even the dullest
students can comprehend them. Instead, the article insists, textbooks
must be more “elitist” and teach real science, which is hard.

Anti-elitists like Kragen and I would agree that textbooks should teach
more real science, which is hard. But we do not consider this elitist,
because we do not believe that only a small elite has the capability of
comprehending physics.

To anti-elitists, egalitarianism does not require lowering standards,
since we believe more people can reach higher standards with more
resources. But to elitists, this seems an impossibility. The only reason
they are in the club is because they deserve it; to let others in
requires bringing the requirements down.
