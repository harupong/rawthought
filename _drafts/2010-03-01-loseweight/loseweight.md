HOWTO: Lose weight

The standard advice for losing weight is to eat less and exercise.

Exercise is almost worthless as a weight-loss strategy: the number of
calories you burn through exercise is miniscule and typically more than
made up by your instinct to eat a little extra after exercising.
Increased exercise is a *consequence* of losing weight, not a cause —
when you lose weight you will have more energy and it will be easier to
move, so you will then exercise. You have to lose weight first.

That leaves eating less. I have found three strategies to be effective
here:

1.  **Get rid of all snacks.** It used to be when I was hungry, I’d just
    grab a snack from the kitchen. It got so I basically did this
    without thinking and, as a result, I ended up eating a lot of
    snacks. Now the only food I have is unprepared; if I want to eat, I
    have to consider it and take the time to actually cook something or
    travel to someplace that sells prepared food.

2.  **Drink more water.** There are [lots of
    reasons](http://www.shapeupshop.com/weightloss/water-weight-loss.html)
    to drink more water, but it’s also a great way to lose weight. A lot
    of what feels like hunger is actually thirst, while having water in
    your stomach seems to counteract certain feelings of hunger.
    Furthermore, burning fat requires extra water.

3.  **Don’t be afraid to be hungry.** This is no doubt my most
    controversial tactic, but I do tend to think the body has a “set
    point” for the number of calories it’s used to consuming. Lowering
    that set point may mean ignoring a bout of hunger or two and
    possibly even going a whole day without eating. But after that, your
    body gets full after eating much less. Again: I’m not saying more
    than a day — this isn’t anorexia — but a one-day fast is far from
    unheard of.

    This may be easier for me since I almost always eat meals alone,
    making it no big deal if I skip them. People who eat meals with
    others may need to get used to only eating a side dish or just
    nibbling at their order.

Losing weight has been better than I ever imagined. Not only am I
dramatically thinner, but I have more energy, I waste less time eating,
and I now like the way I look. I’m much more flexible and mobile and,
most incredibly, I’ve gotten taller — this at the age of 23. (A lot of
people are skeptical that I’ve actually grown taller, but the changes
are measurable and dramatic and come with all the symptoms of height
growth I remember from my childhood (including the strange urge to
stretch vertically on a regular basis). I suppose it’s possible the
height difference simply results from better posture, but that seems
worth counting.)

I do not propose a new diet or some new theory. These are very simple
commonsense tips: remove temptation, get enough water, remove
obligation. But I’ve found they’ve been enough for me to lose dramatic
amounts of weight. I used to be embarrassingly chubby, now people worry
I have anorexia.
