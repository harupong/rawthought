A decade from now, when the seas begin to rise and the earth begins to
boil, who will get blamed? Surely not George W. Bush, who spent 8
crucial years denying the problem, slowing the movement of other
countries, and giving India and China an excuse for delay.

As evidence, look at what happen to Jimmy Carter. He called for a
national investment in alternative energy so that gas-guzzling cars
would be a thing of the past. Reagan scuttled all that and today as oil
prices rise we have very little in the way of alternatives ready. But
the sainted Reagan is never blamed.
