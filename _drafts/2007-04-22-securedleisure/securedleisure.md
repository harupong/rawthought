> When I was disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private
> business, I flattered myself that, by the sufficient though moderate
> fortune I had acquired, had secured leisure during the rest of my life
> for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence’s
> apparatus, who had come from England to lecture in Philadelphia, and I
> proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the
> public, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for
> their purposes; every part of our civil government—and almost at the
> same time—imposing some duty upon me. The Governor put me into the
> commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me one of
> the common council, and soon after alderman; and the citizens at large
> elected me a burgess to represent them in the Assembly.

(Benjamin Franklin, *Autobiography*)
