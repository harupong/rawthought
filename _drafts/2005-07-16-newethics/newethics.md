Change of Course

Here on the Interblog, anyone can write whatever they feel like.
Unconstrained by standards and practices, bloggers feel free to write
anything that’s fair and accurate. For the past ten years, I’ve played
this sorry game — telling you when I thought my friends books sucked,
noting exactly which major media figures offered Schedule III Controlled
Substances to teenagers, and speaking frankly about sex. I have finally
seen the error of my ways. I plan to become [an online
magazine](http://www.thetalentshow.org/archives/001897.html).

No more will I defend saying something simply because it is “the truth”.
No, from now on, I am adopting the rigorous standards of professional
journalists. I’ve been convinced that telling people the truth will just
hurt them and, frankly, I’m a little tired of being mocked and shunned
for my honesty, which goes completely unappreciated by you people.

So, here’s the new regime.

1.  [Like all major
    newspapers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker), there will
    be no factchecking.
2.  [Like
    *Newsweek*](http://www.dissidentvoice.org/May05/Frank0526.htm), I
    will run any possibly unflattering stories by my subjects before
    publishing them.^[1](#fn:1)^
3.  [Like Bob
    Woodward](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/001257.html),
    I will totally adopt the point of view of my sources in a piece,
    even if this means contradicting a previous piece.
4.  [Like Judith
    Miller](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14777-2004Oct7.html),
    I will go to jail in order to protect a source who committed a
    crime.
5.  [Like Judith
    Miller](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/05/27/times/index2.html),
    I will continue to insist my stories are true even when they
    obviously aren’t.
6.  [Like Ceci Connolly of the *Washington
    Post*](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.dailyhowler.com+ceci+connolly)
    and [Chris Vlasto of ABC
    News](http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/06/hillary_clinton/index1.html),
    I will fabricate quotes and doctor audiotapes if it will help my
    political cause.
7.  [Like Elizabeth Bumiller of the *New York
    Times*](http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh032204.shtml), I will write
    complete puff pieces about people in power.
8.  Like practically everyone famous, I will provide glowing blurbs for
    books I’ve never read.
9.  [Like most news outlets](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001677), I
    will no longer try to provide facts about things and instead focus
    on personality.
10. [Like Robert Novak](http://mediamatters.org/items/200408300011), I
    will promote products from my friends and family without disclosing
    my association.

The fun starts tomorrow, with a glowing profile of Seth Finkelstein
(assuming he approves it, of course). But the first thing I plan to do
as a journalist is convene a panel on blogger ethics. Somebody really
needs to stop those guys before things get out of hand.

1.  I remember seeing a more detailed piece about this that included
    quotes from major media figures saying that Newsweek did the right
    thing in this case. I can’t seem to find it but if anybody else can,
    please let me know. [↩](#fnref:1)
