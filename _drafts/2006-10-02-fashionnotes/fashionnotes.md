It is Boston in the Fall, when school starts and the kids begin to pour
in. Because I am a sad and lonely masochist, I have spent some sunny
days walking among the tree-lined streets of the city, observing the
happy, well-bred young people in their natural habitat. I have noticed
that these children of the elite appear to have some patterns in their
choice of clothing and thought that some of my more discerning readers
might wish to know how they too can appear to be a hip young Harvard
student.

**Girls:** Wear a tight bright shirt with a large neck and half-length
sleeves on top of tight light blue jeans.

**Guys:** Wear tight brown hoodies over a dark T-shirt on top of
semi-tight dark blue jeans.

That is all.
