<h1>A Life Offline</h1>

<p>I have literally had a computer since birth; the Internet came not long after that: I still remember email addresses supplemented by UUCP bang-paths. Hardly a day has gone by in which I haven&rsquo;t checked my email for what must be a decade.</p>

<p>The Internet has kept me connected to people&mdash;as a child, all my best friends were online; as an adult, all my coworkers are. My jobs do not take place in an office; they take place over email, where time and place do not matter. The upside, is that I can go anywhere and still do them. The downside, is I cannot get away from them.</p>

<p>I need to take a break. My life has become entangled with technology and pressure that I hardly know any other way of life. So I&rsquo;m planning to spend the month of June (June 6 to July 4, to be exact) offline. I&rsquo;m packing up the laptop and the cable modem and sending them someplace far away. I&rsquo;m going back to the world of paper and books.</p>

<p>Of course, my phone is now a computer too, so that will also have to go. I don&rsquo;t have a landline, so if folks want to talk to me they&rsquo;ll have to write letters (<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/contact">here&rsquo;s my address</a>). I (amazingly) don&rsquo;t have any clocks or calendars, so I won&rsquo;t even know what time it is. All of which means no more meetings or coordinating to hang out with people. I suppose people could call on me, but honestly, I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t &mdash; at least at first.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like the kind of person who could survive on Walden Pond &mdash; I&rsquo;m a finicky eater and not a huge fan of animals in any capacity. So locking myself in my apartment seems about as close as I can get. There will of course be the clerks at stores and people on the street, but for the most part I&rsquo;ll be alone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with it a little &mdash; both my phone and my laptop have died recently &mdash; and it&rsquo;s liberating. Walking down the street or waiting in lines, I find myself checking my phone compulsively, using it to send my mind to some other world of email or news. Without it, I feel grounded. And my laptop is even worse &mdash; a beckoning world of IMs to friends, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/58538/">brain-gelatinizing television shows</a>, and an endless pile of emails to answer. It&rsquo;s like a constant stream of depression. A day without it made me feel like I was human again.</p>

<p>I want to be human again. Even if that means isolating myself from the rest of you humans.</p>

<p>What if there&rsquo;s an emergency? Has there ever been an emergency? The biggest urgent things seem to be that my servers go down. Which sucks, but I need to be able to walk away from that. If you have things hosted on one of my machines, contact me now and I&rsquo;ll try to get you enough privileges that you can fix things if they break. If something&rsquo;s really an emergency, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find me.</p>

<p>Have a nice June.</p>
