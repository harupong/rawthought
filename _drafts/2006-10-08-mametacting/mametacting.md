*A special guest post from David Mamet’s* [True and
False](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679772642). *The discussion is
notionally about acting, but it applies far more broadly. Try
substituting “programmer” for “actor”, for example.*

> Those with “something to fall back on” invariably fall back on it.
> They intended to all along. That is why they provided themselves with
> it. But those with no alternative see the world differently. […]
>
> Those of you with nothing to fall back on, you will find, *are* home.

> The audition process selects for the most blatant (and not even the
> most attractive) of the supplicants. As a hiring tool, it is geared to
> reject all but the hackneyed, the stock, the predictable—in short, the
> counterfeit.

> The producers are not interested in discovering the new. Who in their
> right mind would bet twenty million dollars on an untried actor? They
> want the old—and if they cannot have it, they want its facsimile.
>
> These gatekeepers understand their job to be this: to supply the
> appropriate, predictable actor for the part. They base their choice on
> the actor’s appearance, credits, and quote—as if they were hiring a
> plumber.
>
> If this sounds tedious, reflect that the actor himself is habituated
> into the process and endorses it from his first experience of it. And
> his first experience is the school.
>
> The acting school and its lessons are may times harsh, but their rigor
> and extent is comfortable and predictable. The lessons of the stage,
> on the other hand, are often devastating and almost beyond bearing.
>
> The school, like the audition process, has a clear and simple
> structure of commands and rewards. If, and as long as, the student
> propitiates the teacher, she may be disappointed but she will rarely
> be humiliated. To the extent that she internalizes her subscription to
> the system (“It is harsh, but I know in my heart it is just, or at the
> very least, unavoidable”) she can enjoy freedom from anomie. If she
> never ventures out of the confines of the system, she can live,
> whether employed or unemployed, free from terror.
>
> Teachers of “audition technique” counsel actors to consider the
> audition itself the performance, and to gear all one’s hopes and
> aspirations not to toward the actual practice of one’s craft (which
> takes place in from of an audience or a camera), but toward the
> possibility of appealing to some functionary. What could be more
> awful?
>
> For much of the beauty of the theatre, and much of the happiness, is
> in a communion with the audience. The audience comes to the show
> prepared to respond as a communal unit. They come prepared (and
> expecting) to be surprised and delighted. They are not only willing,
> but disposed to endorse the unusual, the honest, the piquant.
> Everything the audition process discards.

> Don’t “confess” when you come offstage. If you have gained an insight,

> keep those words in—how comforting they are. In saying them one
> creates an imaginary group interested in one’s progress. But give up
> the comfort of an imaginary group. This “group” that is judging you is
> not real; you invented it to make yourself feel less alone.

> I knew a man who went to Hollywood and languished jobless for a period

> Well, so would we all. But who are “they”? And what are the rules?
> There *is* no “they,” and there are no rules. He posited the existence

> The audience, on the other hand, *can* be pleased. They come to the

> Keep your wits about you. It is not necessary to barter your talent,
> your self-esteem, and you youth for the *chance* of pleasing your

> go your own way, to form your own theatre company, to write and stage
> your *own* plays, to make your *own* films. You have an enormously
> greater chance of eventually presenting yourself to, and eventually
> appealing to, an audience by striking out on your won, by making your
> *own* plays and films, than by submitting to the industrial model of
> the school and studio.
>
> But how will you act when you, whether occasionally or frequently,
> come up against the gatekeepers?
>
> Why not do the best you can, see them as, if you will, an inevitable
> and preexisting condition, like ants at a picnic, and shrug and enjoy
> yourself in spite of them.
>
> *Do not internalize the industrial model.* You are not one of the
