(Joan Didion, *Slouching Towards Bethlehem*, xv-xvi)

> In fact I have abandoned altogether that kind of pointless entry;
> instead I tell what some would call lies. “That’s simply not true,”
> the members of my family frequently tell me when they come up against
> my memory of a shared event. “The party was *not* for you, the spider
> was *not* a black widow, *it wasn’t that way at all*.” Very likely
> they are right, for not only have I always had trouble distinguishing
> between what happened and what merely might have happened, but I
> remain unconvinced that the distinction, for my purposes, matters. The
> cracked crab that I recall having for lunch the day my father came
> home from Detroit in 1945 must certainly be embroidery, worked into
> the day’s pattern to lend verisimilitude; I was ten years old and
> would not now remember the cracked crab. The day’s events did not turn
> on cracked crab. And yet it is precisely that fictitious crab that
> makes me see the afternoon all over again, a home movie run all too
> often, the father bearing gifts, the child weeping, an exercise in
> family love and guilt. Or that is what it was to me. Similarly,
> perhaps it never did snow that August in Vermont; perhaps there never
> were flurries in the night wind and maybe no one else felt the ground
> hardening and summer already dead even as we pretended to bask in it,
> but that was how it felt to me, and it might as well have snowed,
> could have snowed, did snow.
