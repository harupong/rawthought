What Are Intellectuals Good For?

There was once an era where great men strode among us. The
Intellectuals, as they were known, had an opinion on everything and
would share it, at length, with elegance and verve. Unfortunately, the
explosion of information beginning in the sixties rendered them
all-but-extinct and the electronic transformation of the past few
decades threatens to finish the job. Still, we can’t but admire them and
their milieu.

This certainly seems to be George Scialabba’s position. The greatest
working book reviewer — when the National Book Critics Circle
inaugurated their Excellence in Criticism award, he was their first
recipient — collects his reviews of these grand men’s work and a
sampling of his own in his new collection, *What Are Intellectuals Good
For?* The result is a delightful introduction to this world of ideas.

Scialabba’s own position is best summarized by his dedication: “For
Chomsky, Rorty, Lasch.” In other words, he is a man of impeccable
left-wing politics, a refusal to believe in any philosophical verities,
and a deep skepticism about the benefits of Enlightenment progress. This
is not exactly a popular combination — surely Chomsky and Ehrenreich
have more fans than Rorty and Lasch — but it is a provocative one. And
Scialabba’s genius is that he can make such counterintuitive ideas,
expressed by such Olympian intellectuals, seem not just clear but common
sense. A dedicated follower of the left-rationalist-progressive
tradition, I had to continually catch myself from nodding along in
agreement.

Recommended for anyone who’s a fan of the Intellectual Scene and the men
and women who inhabit it.

*Disclosure:* Scialabba sent me an inscribed copy of the book.
