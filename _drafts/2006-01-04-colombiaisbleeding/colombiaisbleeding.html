<p><em>Nellie McKay is having trouble getting her new album,</em> Pretty Little Head, <em>released, apparently due to the content of artistic differences with the record label. The best song on the album, and one that is particularly mentioned in this regard, is &ldquo;Columbia is Bleeding&rdquo;, her vicious portrayal of college life while students are oblivious to <a href="http://www.columbiacruelty.com/">the animal torture going on around them</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>However, it seems like the song might really be more appropriate for <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm">a different Colombia</a>. Here, then, are those lyrics&hellip;</em></p>

<p>another day begins<br>
you check the news<br>
ah-sass-ih-nay-she-uns<br>
here come the footstep of the man who&rsquo;ll end your life<br>
the rifle&rsquo;s is fitted in<br>
and there you are<br>
the shot is targeted<br>
then a scream</p>

<p>hold your placard up / cold and coffee cup<br>
after go to a bar<br>
hand your flier out / must admire<br>
how dedicated you are<br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know if biz is boomin&rsquo;<br>
or the goods you make are on sale<br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know &lsquo;bout your <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Haiti/NoblePhase_GHRTT.html">&ldquo;saintly glow&rdquo; or your &ldquo;noble&rdquo; show</a><br>
or if you think you ought to bail</p>

<p>Chris Hogan / she had to run<br>
last night&rsquo;d been a lot of fun<br>
but now it&rsquo;s french / a little tense<br>
she hadn&rsquo;t done the reading<br>
there she sat / hoped to pass<br>
didn&rsquo;t think to face the fact<br>
that oh by gosh o lack o lass<br>
colombia is bleeding<br>
walkin&rsquo; down / off the bus<br>
Vicky Lucas crossed campus was<br>
thinkin&rsquo; how she&rsquo;s made it now<br>
that successful feeling<br>
walked by fast / hoped to pass 
no clue &lsquo;bout the shirt she has<br>
and while she&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo; in lit class<br>
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>the union is in town<br>
and there they are<br>
the forces come on down<br>
then a scream</p>

<p>everybody knows protesters are those<br>
schmoes who don&rsquo;t have a life<br>
see these businessmen seeking profit and<br>
have to suffer such strife<br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know if the world is flat<br>
or you can&rsquo;t check your email<br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_07_31_atrios_archive.html#112307924462696350">if your cell won&rsquo;t work or that guy&rsquo;s a jerk </a><br>
or if you think you ought to bail</p>

<p>generalize, proselytize, verbs were spillin&rsquo; out their sides<br>
as Charles Eise buys his supplies gets ready for a meeting<br>
tried for track / hit the mat<br>
didn&rsquo;t think to face the fact<br>
that while he&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; &ldquo;man, that&rsquo;s wack!&rdquo;<br>
colombia is bleeding<br>
quite a snob he didn&rsquo;t tip<br>
nice guy Rob watched the eclipse<br>
and looked around / &ldquo;i&rsquo;ve made it now<br>
i&rsquo;m just so glad to be here&rdquo;<br>
made a pass / got hand slapped<br>
didn&rsquo;t think to face the fact<br>
that while he&rsquo;s mackin&rsquo; on that ass<br>
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>the catholic religion<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology">decides to help the poor</a><br>
while we rename the school in<br><a href="http://www.soaw.org/">which we train the men</a> and<br>
then a scream</p>

<p>they&rsquo;re just criminals / make good worker cells<br><a href="http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm">pushing drugs and disease</a><br>
empire&rsquo;s pretty fun / we got power, son<br><a href="http://www.afn.org/~iguana/archives/2003_11/20031112.html">we can do as we please</a><br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know &lsquo;bout your drug war claims<br>
or how it&rsquo;s gonna fail<br>
i don&rsquo;t wanna know if you need to show you&rsquo;re a real madman<br>
or you think you&rsquo;re gonna bail<br>
hail!</p>

<p>Tee-Tee Green / pressed mezzanine<br>
ended up beside the team<br>
and gave a cheer / got some beers<br>
with friends who started drinkin&rsquo;<br>
back with Zach said &ldquo;i look fat&rdquo;<br>
didn&rsquo;t think to face the fact<br>
that while she&rsquo;s under self-attack<br>
colombia is bleeding<br>
Rodney J. began to pray<br>
his momma lost her life that day<br>
had been a year / it wasn&rsquo;t clear<br>
if he was safe or screamin&rsquo;<br>
as he jabbed the bible flap<br>
he didn&rsquo;t think to face the beast<br>
of profiteering that killed the priest<br>
colombia is bleeding</p>

<p>this is america</p>
