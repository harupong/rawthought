*Nellie McKay is having trouble getting her new album,* Pretty Little
Head, *released, apparently due to the content of artistic differences
with the record label. The best song on the album, and one that is
particularly mentioned in this regard, is “Columbia is Bleeding”, her
vicious portrayal of college life while students are oblivious to [the
animal torture going on around them](http://www.columbiacruelty.com/).*

*However, it seems like the song might really be more appropriate for [a
different Colombia](http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm).
Here, then, are those lyrics…*

another day begins\
 you check the news\
 ah-sass-ih-nay-she-uns\
 here come the footstep of the man who’ll end your life\
 the rifle’s is fitted in\
 and there you are\
 the shot is targeted\
 then a scream

hold your placard up / cold and coffee cup\
 after go to a bar\
 hand your flier out / must admire\
 how dedicated you are\
 i don’t wanna know if biz is boomin’\
 or the goods you make are on sale\
 i don’t wanna know ‘bout your [“saintly glow” or your “noble”
show](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Haiti/NoblePhase_GHRTT.html)\
 or if you think you ought to bail

Chris Hogan / she had to run\
 last night’d been a lot of fun\
 but now it’s french / a little tense\
 she hadn’t done the reading\
 there she sat / hoped to pass\
 didn’t think to face the fact\
 that oh by gosh o lack o lass\
 colombia is bleeding\
 walkin’ down / off the bus\
 Vicky Lucas crossed campus was\
 thinkin’ how she’s made it now\
 that successful feeling\
 walked by fast / hoped to pass no clue ‘bout the shirt she has\
 and while she’s sittin’ in lit class\
 colombia is bleeding

the union is in town\
 and there they are\
 the forces come on down\
 then a scream

everybody knows protesters are those\
 schmoes who don’t have a life\
 see these businessmen seeking profit and\
 have to suffer such strife\
 i don’t wanna know if the world is flat\
 or you can’t check your email\
 i don’t wanna know [if your cell won’t work or that guy’s a
jerk](http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_07_31_atrios_archive.html#112307924462696350)\
 or if you think you ought to bail

generalize, proselytize, verbs were spillin’ out their sides\
 as Charles Eise buys his supplies gets ready for a meeting\
 tried for track / hit the mat\
 didn’t think to face the fact\
 that while he’s thinkin’ “man, that’s wack!”\
 colombia is bleeding\
 quite a snob he didn’t tip\
 nice guy Rob watched the eclipse\
 and looked around / “i’ve made it now\
 i’m just so glad to be here”\
 made a pass / got hand slapped\
 didn’t think to face the fact\
 that while he’s mackin’ on that ass\
 colombia is bleeding

the catholic religion\
[decides to help the
poor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology)\
 while we rename the school in\
[which we train the men](http://www.soaw.org/) and\
 then a scream

they’re just criminals / make good worker cells\
[pushing drugs and
disease](http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm)\
 empire’s pretty fun / we got power, son\
[we can do as we
please](http://www.afn.org/~iguana/archives/2003_11/20031112.html)\
 i don’t wanna know ‘bout your drug war claims\
 or how it’s gonna fail\
 i don’t wanna know if you need to show you’re a real madman\
 or you think you’re gonna bail\
 hail!

Tee-Tee Green / pressed mezzanine\
 ended up beside the team\
 and gave a cheer / got some beers\
 with friends who started drinkin’\
 back with Zach said “i look fat”\
 didn’t think to face the fact\
 that while she’s under self-attack\
 colombia is bleeding\
 Rodney J. began to pray\
 his momma lost her life that day\
 had been a year / it wasn’t clear\
 if he was safe or screamin’\
 as he jabbed the bible flap\
 he didn’t think to face the beast\
 of profiteering that killed the priest\
 colombia is bleeding

this is america
