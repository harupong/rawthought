<h1>Redesign</h1>

<p>I was going through my weblog archives the other day and found an early post I&rsquo;d written <em>nine years ago</em> (in yet another piece of blogging software I&rsquo;d written myself&hellip;). But what was even more shocking than the notion that I&rsquo;d been blogging for over a decade was that my web design back then was better than it was today.</p>

<p>This really kept nagging at me, so I took a couple hours tonight to do a redesign. I still have very little in the way of <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/2taste">positive artistic talent</a>, so it&rsquo;s nothing impressive, but I do hope that it will keep me from recoiling in horror from my own weblog. My apologies to everyone I borrowed design features from.</p>

<p>Feel free to use this thread to comment on the redesign.</p>
