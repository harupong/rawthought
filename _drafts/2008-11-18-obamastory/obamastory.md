[John
Comaroff](http://anthropology.uchicago.edu/courses/faculty/johncomaroff.shtml)
is a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, where
Barack Obama used to teach. Obama still lives in the neighborhood, Hyde
Park. Recently, [on the radio show *Open
Source*](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Watson_Institute/Open_Source/RadioOpenSource-John_Comaroff.mp3),
Comaroff told this story:

> We have a cleaner in our building — 70-something-year-old African
> American guy; sweet, sweet guy. And every evening he comes into our
> office about six and takes our garbage and stuff. … He didn’t come in
> on Tuesday — I was up late, working until I went to see election
> results.
>
> Of course, Hyde Park was abuzz. Hyde Park thinks of this election as
> its own. And the fact that the Obama kids were at school on Tuesday
> and Wednesday, and we all had to ride around the TV cameras to get to
> our parking, was the kind of masochistic pleasure that we’re having in
> Hyde Park, which after all has always been told it’s the fringe of the
> nation. We’ve always been told that nothing we do or say counts
> anywhere else, especially not across the border in Indiana. So to
> suddenly find ourselves at the center of the political process is
> interesting.
>
> So [on Wednesday] the guy comes into my office and I say “So, where
> were you yesterday?” “Ah,” he says, “I was in Grant Park [where Obama
> gave his victory speech].” “Grant Park?” “Yeah, right near the front —
> I could have touched Barack Obama.” “How did you get there? It’s tough
> to get tickets.”
>
> He said “You don’t understand. A few years back, I worked Law School,
> I cleaned the Law School. And Obama’s office was on my run. He worked
> late many nights and he was really interested. I’d come by cleaning
> and he’d always stop me for a chat. Sometimes he’d share food with me
> — he always brought food in — and the thing was, he sat down and he
> talked to me. He said ‘Tell me about your community. Tell me what’s
> going on out there. I wanna know. I wanna know what’s out there on the
> streets. I wanna know how America is living.’”
>
> And one got the sense that this guy, alienated from the political
> process, alienated from the work process, found in Obama a real human
> being.
