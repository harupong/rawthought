I really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham. Paul Graham is an excellent
writer and a very nice fellow. But when he said that thing that made me
look bad, I just had to draw the line. For years, I’ve been doing
something and telling people I’m doing it and then all of a sudden Paul
Graham comes along and tells me it’s a bad idea. I think it’s time to
question his assumptions.

In his essay, Graham writes:

> Most people in this situation typically do this thing. But what if
> they did this other thing instead? This idea typically doesn’t occur
> to them for that reason. But if they did what I suggest, they’d be
> like a metaphor instead of a simile.

Here’s where Graham really goes off the rails. What if we don’t want to
do what he suggests? Graham never considers that possibility. He just
assumes that he’s right.

Once, in an interview, Graham was asked what he thought about this
subject:

> *Q: What do you think of people doing that thing?*
>
> Well, you know, historically people really haven’t done a lot of this
> thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening
> because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no
> longer exist. This could really change things.

But this is absurd! Just because people *can* do that thing now doesn’t
mean they’re going to.

For too long, Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that
disagree with people’s prejudices in an informative and entertaining
manner. That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and
read it. But this time he’s gone too far: he’s said something that might
actually make me change how I behave. And that’s unacceptable.
