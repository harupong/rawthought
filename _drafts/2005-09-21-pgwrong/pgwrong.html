<h1>Paul Graham is Wrong</h1>

<p>I really enjoyed that essay by Paul Graham. Paul Graham is an excellent writer and a very nice fellow. But when he said that thing that made me look bad, I just had to draw the line. For years, I&rsquo;ve been doing something and telling people I&rsquo;m doing it and then all of a sudden Paul Graham comes along and tells me it&rsquo;s a bad idea. I think it&rsquo;s time to question his assumptions.</p>

<p>In his essay, Graham writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people in this situation typically do this thing. But what if they did this other thing instead? This idea typically doesn&rsquo;t occur to them for that reason. But if they did what I suggest, they&rsquo;d be like a metaphor instead of a simile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where Graham really goes off the rails. What if we don&rsquo;t want to do what he suggests? Graham never considers that possibility. He just assumes that he&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>Once, in an interview, Graham was asked what he thought about this subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q: What do you think of people doing that thing?</em></p>
  
  <p>Well, you know, historically people really haven&rsquo;t done a lot of this thing and going forwards I see a lot more of this thing happening because the things that have stopped people from doing those things no longer exist. This could really change things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is absurd! Just because people <em>can</em> do that thing now doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re going to.</p>

<p>For too long, Paul Graham has gotten a free ride by saying things that disagree with people&rsquo;s prejudices in an informative and entertaining manner. That was fine when all we had to do was link to his article and read it. But this time he&rsquo;s gone too far: he&rsquo;s said something that might actually make me change how I behave. And that&rsquo;s unacceptable.</p>

  <p>A satire worthy of Swift :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/pgwrong#c10">Sencer explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Graham has always written the way he has written. That (among real reasoning) includes making assertions and peddling his own views as a kind of fact. The same people that are applauding Graham for &ldquo;brilliant reasoning&rdquo; when he makes assertions that fit their world-view, criticize him for the absurdity of even making assertions, when they don&rsquo;t fit their world-view. Not that they shouldn&rsquo;t, but the inconsistency is just funny in an ironic kind of way. :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;m so glad that someone stood up to him finally. Some of what he says at such as about Amateurs is a bunch of bull crap. [&hellip;] Paul Graham is not &ldquo;god&rdquo; and some of what he says really ought to not be left unchecked and thank you Aaron for having the guts to stand up to him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/pgwrong#c11">In opposition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>err what is the point of this? You establishing a reputation and personality off the back of Paul Graham? Man, you&rsquo;re pretty shameless and petty. You think you&rsquo;ve stumbled onto a gold landfill by realizing you don&rsquo;t agree with Graham? How many millions of people have read a paul graham essay? [&hellip;] Graham backs up his word with some good thought and informed opinions. YOU??? what do you base it on? the need to get noticed?</p>
