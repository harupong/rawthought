A new study finds that marriage has been making people increasingly
unhappy for the past 30 years. Even when they say they’re happy with
their relationship, married people are unhappier overall. Indeed, the
effect is so large that it cancels out the happiness gains the unmarried
population has made in the past 30 years.

Meanwhile, in Portugal the police have been arresting whole
neighborhoods and transporting them all to jail. Now prisoners can serve
with their old family and friends.

Rich countries tend to be more accepting of minorities, while most
strippers have terrible working conditions. Moving increases crime, the
DUI gender gap is narrowing, and media coverage encourages sports
hooligans. Young people are increasingly critical of war.

Blacks are moving back to the south, while dual citizenship is
increasingly permitted. Ugandans educated at foreign colleges and
universities are twice as likely to be employed as equally-educated
Ugandans who never left and three times as likely to be employed as
foreign-born immigrants.

Appalachian boys prefer working with their hands to booksmarts.
