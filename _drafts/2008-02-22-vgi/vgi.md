Oxford University Press has a wonderful series they call [Very Short
Introductions](http://www.oup.co.uk/general/vsi/). The books are small,
short, colorful paperbacks with titles like “The Brain”, “Political
Philosophy” or “The Tudors”. For each one, the editors find an expert in
the field, have them write a brief overview of all the relevant areas of
study (thus the book on “Globalization” covers economics, politics,
culture, environment, ideology, and the opposition movement) and edits
them to be clear and concise.

The result is a very good series of books, and I’ve enjoyed them
immensely, but it’s not quite what I want. For one thing, the shortness
of the books (they’re usually about a hundred half-size pages) makes
them unfulfilling. It’s impossible to get a real understanding of a big
topic in fifty pages, especially when many of them are taken up
summarizing related concerns. (Perhaps you could provide a nice overview
of economic globalization in fifty pages, but covering economic,
political, cultural, environmental, and ideological globalization in
that space is absurd.)

And the other is that, however great the editors at OUP, it seems
impossible that they would be able to commission the best exposition of
every topic for one series. Many of the greatest writers are not going
to accept a particular commission, do not approve of some piece of the
series’ style, or perhaps want credit or attention for themselves rather
than being just another book in a huge OUP series.

So that’s why I’d like us to put together our own series — not of very
short introductions, but of very good ones. These are books which a) try
to explain a whole subject with b) clarity and even joy while making c)
no strong assumptions of prior knowledge and d) not dumbing the subject
down. It’s an extremely rare combination — there are many books on
subjects that are good but unreadable by the average person, while
there’s a whole industry churning out pop sci pageturners that
communicate little actual knowledge of a subject. But the rare book that
actually achieves all four of these goals is a true gem, and ought to be
promoted more widely.

Please post your suggestions in the comments and I’ll try to assemble a
list of them next week. I’ll go first:

> *[Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal
> System](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195179579)* by Jay M. Feinman
>
> This delightful book goes over the key points of constitutional law,
> civil procedure, torts, contracts, property, criminal law, etc. with
> wit, style, and lots of great examples. Sit down not knowing anything
> about the subject and come away with a clear enough understanding of
> torts, contracts, and crimes to apply the ideas in your daily life.

OK, your turn.
