The other day I had [a lengthy
interview](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-05-07-n78.html) with
Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped, which he’s now posted with little
editing. It’s interesting to see how stilted my normal IM conversation
sounds when reformated into paragraphs.

I say a bunch of things in the interview that are probably going to
upset various people I know. In my defense, it was an interview — I
didn’t rehearse my remarks in advance — but I’ll post corrections here
if I said anything outrageously wrong.

Postscript: I did finish Intuition. It took me surprisingly long to
realize it was just a novelization of the Baltimore affair!
