The other week in a post titled [Fear and Loathing in Biotechnology
Firms](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fearandbio), I wrote:

In response, I recently received the following comment from a poster who
goes by the name “I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT”:

I’d like to take this moment to correct the record. Upon reflection,
security sat behind a barrier that was indeed tall enough to make it a
“counter” and not a “desk”. We at *Raw Thought* deplore the casual use
of language that causes many speakers to conflate counters with desks
and we strive for precision in these matters. We deeply regret the
error.

I’d also like to take this moment to correct another error. The same
article suggests the same so-called “desk” was reached after “ducking
into a door”. After a further review of notes by the author, we have
concluded that it was not actually a door, but more of a small hallway
leading to several doors, really a kind of alcove actually.

I hope this post underscores our commitment to “facts” at *Raw Thought*.
We continue to stand by our claims that journalists noses look bigger
while on drugs, that giant vats of transgenic corn cure cancer, that
CostCo is authentically historic, and that Genentech is the Best Company
to Work For in America. We can only hope that its employees continue to
read our quality content.
