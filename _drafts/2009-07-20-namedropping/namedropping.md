I was having tea the other day with Nancy Pelosi, when she got a call
from her good friend Tom Hanks. Tom wanted to tell her about how heâ€™d
been out with his favorite shopping partner, Paris Hilton, when Paris
accidentally swung a bag of clothes into the face of her aide, Ken
Burns. Ken, of course, was already feeling bad after losing his
therapist, Warren Buffett. He had to fire him after Warren kept spending
their sessions raving about his new chef, Frank Gehry. Frank, you know,
always left work in a towering rage, going home to scream obscenities at
his housekeeper, Thomas Friedman. Last time Thomas took it out on a cab
driver, Woody Allen. Woody spent the rest of the day feeling dejected
until, on his way home, he was approached by Richard Posner, covered in
rags and begging for spare change.
