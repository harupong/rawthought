<p class="dateline">Saturday, June 25 &mdash; Harvard Law School Campus</p>

<p>After wandering around stupidly for about an hour, I see a crowd of people outside the one door I didn&rsquo;t bother trying to open (all the others were locked). Yep, they&rsquo;re definitely Creative Commons people. There&rsquo;s Hal Abelson, who seems not to recognize me. And there&rsquo;s Mike who says hi but then gets pulled away. I push inside and get a bottle of water. And there&rsquo;s Larry Lessig! &lsquo;Wow, you look like you&rsquo;ve lost a million pounds,&rsquo; Larry says. &lsquo;Is that true?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve lost a <em>million</em> pounds,&rsquo; I reply.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that the way I looked would change much. I would always be the little kid in the corner, the guy who definitely stands out. But then I was looking at some old photos of me receiving the ArsDigita prize and I realize I really do look rather different. Then I was ugly, short, fat, awkward, and poorly-dressed. Now I&rsquo;m taller and definitely much thinner (although that seems to change), I wear better-looking clothes, and my face has become rather handsome-looking, especially on the occasions when I shave it. Now when I meet people they don&rsquo;t recognize me &mdash; they wait until I introduce myself or  sort of stare at me blankly before they realize who I am &mdash; that never used to happen before.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m here to check out the iCommons summit. Creative Commons has grown from a couple former students of Larry&rsquo;s to a large international &ldquo;movement&rdquo; (as all the speakers insist on calling it), the most prominent members of which have been flown out to Harvard from around the world thanks to Soros&rsquo;s foundation. Charlie Nesson gives the day&rsquo;s closing keynote, describing his vision of an indestructible world library.</p>

<p>We then retire to Charlie Nesson&rsquo;s house, which is the typical sort of cocktail party-type affair. When I&rsquo;m not looking, Lessig gets pushed into Nesson&rsquo;s pool. &lsquo;I believe this is the only area where it is appropriate to say this,&rsquo; says one legally-trained guest, &lsquo;but he was asking for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When I tell him that I&rsquo;m out here to start a company, a descendent of Robert Boyle (of Boyle&rsquo;s law) offers to invest. &lsquo;But we don&rsquo;t have anything,&rsquo; I insist. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s OK,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll succeed at some point.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I spend most of the night talking to Mike Linksvayer, who I end up walking back with, and we end up talking for hours outside the subway stop, long into the night, long after the subway has stopped running, so I buy a box of Cheerios and a bottle of water from a 7-11 and walk the way back to my dorm room, listening to radical radio shows podcast onto my iPod.</p>

<p>The phone rings. It&rsquo;s my father. &lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m here,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Oh. I forgot you were coming. I was just going to see Lessig give a closing keynote.&rsquo; I agree to meet him on the way there and halfway between my dorm and his hotel, there he is, smiling widely. My dad and I have not really spoken in person since almost a year ago, when he used force and trickery to prevent me from going to FOO Camp in a stupid show of power. He&rsquo;s much nicer now. I think he misses me.</p>

<p>As we walk and talk a kid in front of us keeps looking behind at me. At first I think it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve said, but he keeps doing it. Finally he stops and says, &lsquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re that weblogger guy, right?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yeah,&rsquo; I say. &lsquo;Aaron something. Yeah, I read your site.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wow,&rsquo; I say. &lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m here for the Linguistics summer school. Maybe I&rsquo;ll see you around some time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; I say hopefully.</p>

<p>I ask if my Dad wants to come with to Lessig&rsquo;s keynote and he agrees.</p>

<p>I get to chat a bit with Ben Adida who, having been left with my legacy of using RDF for Creative Commons found himself chair of the RDF-in-HTML task force (quite possibly the worst job in the W3C &mdash; I should ask him how he did it sometime) and, now discovering that overnight a major competitor (Microformats, pushed by Technorati) has arisen, is trying to get them to convert. I&rsquo;ve been friends with the Technorati guys and I take their position, telling Ben that it&rsquo;s a hopeless endeavor. Ben is a little shocked at this &mdash; I was the one who got him on the RDF train after all &mdash; and pushes back. And eventually he manages to convince me that it wouldn&rsquo;t require hardly any additional work from the Microformats guys to be RDF/A-compatible.</p>

<p>Joi Ito waves from behind Ben.</p>

<p>After Lessig&rsquo;s speech, we head off and find dinner.</p>
