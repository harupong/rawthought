From Corey Robin’s fantastic book *[The Reactionary
Mind](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0199793743)*:

> Great power, [Burke] suggests in *The Sublime and the Beautiful*,
> should never aspire to be—and can never actually be—beautiful. What
> great power needs is sublimity. The sublime is the sensation we
> experience in the face of extreme pain, danger, or terror. It is
> something like awe but tinged with fear and dread. Burke calls it
> “delightful horror.” Great power should aspire to sublimity rather
> than beauty because sublimity produces “the strongest emotion which
> the mind is capable of feeling.” It is an arresting yet invigorating
> emotion, which has the simultaneous but contradictory effect of
> diminishing and magnifying us. We feel annihiliated by great power; at
> the same time, our sense of self “swell[s]” when “we are conversant
> with terrible objects.” Great power achieves sublimity when it is,
> among other things, obscure and mysterious, and when it is extreme.
> “In all things,” writes Burke, the sublime “abhors
> mediocrity.”^[1](#fn:fn18)^
>
> In the *Reflections*, Burke suggests that the problem in France is
> that the old regime is beautiful while the revolution is sublime. The
> landed interest, the cornerstone of the old regime, is “sluggish,
> inert, and timid.” It cannot defend itself “from the invasions of
> ability,” with ability standing in here for the new men of power that
> the revolution brings forth. Elsewhere in the *Reflections*, Burke
> says that the moneyed interest, which is allied with the revolution,
> is stronger than the aristocratic interest because it is “more ready
> for any adventure” and “more disposed to new enterprises of any kind.”
> The old regime, in other words, is beautiful, static, and weak; the
> revolution is ugly, dynamic, and strong. And in the horrors that the
> revolution perpetrates—the rabble rushing into the bedchamber of the
> queen, dragging her half-naked into the street, and marching her and
> her family to Paris—the revolution achieves a kind of sublimity: “We
> are alarmed into reflexion,” writes Burke of the revolutionaries’
> actions. “Our minds … are purified by terror and pity; our weak
> unthinking pride is humbled, under the dispensations of a mysterious
> wisdom.^[2](#fn:fn19)^
>
> Beyond these simple professions of envy or admiration, the
> conservative actually copies and learns from the revolution he
> opposes. “To destroy that enemy,” Burke wrote of the Jacobins, “by
> some means or other, the force opposed to it should be made to bear
> some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit which that system
> exerts.”^[3](#fn:fn20)^

Is it not all here, right down to the moneyed interests allying with the
revolution and the revolution throwing the aristocrats from their
bedchambers?
