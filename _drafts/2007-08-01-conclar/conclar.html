<h1>Consciousness Clarified</h1>

<p>You ever notice how when you learn a new word you begin seeing it used everywhere? Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling that way about consciousness. I knew the word before, obviously, but lately I&rsquo;ve clarified my thoughts about what it <em>is</em> and sloppy usage of the term sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consciousness&rdquo;, the dictionary kindly explains, is &ldquo;the state or condition of being conscious.&rdquo; And we all basically know what it means to be conscious. You poke someone awake and ask &ldquo;Are you conscious?&rdquo; You get hit on the head by a large rock and you get knocked unconscious. Being conscious, in short, means being awake, being aware of your surroundings, seeing colors and feeling pinches and hearing songs.</p>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s something weird about being conscious &mdash; something so weird, in fact, that I&rsquo;ve found many people are bizarrely tempted to deny it. Consciousness is what the philosopher John Searle calls &ldquo;ontologically subjective&rdquo;. That is, when you see the color red, while it&rsquo;s true that all sorts of complicated things happen in your eyes and brains, a particular experience &mdash; the one we call &ldquo;seeing red&rdquo; &mdash; happens only to you. If aliens with the most powerful viewing technology possible beamed down to earth and peeked inside your brain, they&rsquo;d still have no idea what the color red looked like. They&rsquo;d see that a certain wavelength of light triggered certain electrical impulses in certain centers, but they&rsquo;d never see <em>red</em>. It&rsquo;s just not there.</p>

<p>Now we don&rsquo;t know for sure what <em>causes</em> consciousness (it&rsquo;s an ongoing research project) but whatever the answer is, it must be caused by <em>something</em>. Yet this obvious fact is continually missed by laypeople who make bizarre comments like &ldquo;as soon as computers become self-aware, they might become conscious&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This is as absurd as saying that as soon as computers are told about food, they might start digesting things.</p>

<p>Consciousness isn&rsquo;t some vague property of things that look smart to us. It has a real, physical meaning: feeling things. I suppose it&rsquo;s logically possible that a talking robot might start feeling things, but the chances seem awfully remote.</p>
