John Hockenberry is a long-time, well-known American journalist. He’s
won four Emmy awards and three Peabody awards. Now that, as he puts it,
“mainstream media doesn’t want John Hockenberry anymore,” he’s become a
Distinguished Fellow at the MIT Media Lab, where [he recently gave a
talk](http://www.media.mit.edu/events/eventpage.php?event=talk-398)
which commented on some of his experiences covering the Iraq war while
at NBC.

Here are some excerpts:

> I was very happily employed at NBC. I wasn’t like, running around,
> trying to stuff toilet paper into the plumbing and sabotage the place.
> […] But I was interested, because we had a lot of meetings at NBC
> about, you know, if you’re doing a story and the person you’re doing
> the story about offers to buy you a drink, you’ve gotta say no. If
> you’re doing a story and they send you, after they see the story, some
> napkin rings — silver napkin rings that are monogrammed “Thank you,
> Jon, for the story,” you’ve got not only to return those, you’ve got
> to report those to the standards people at NBC because there’s a whole
> ethics and conflict-of-interest thing.
>
> So at one of these ethics meetings — I called them the
> return-the-napkin-ring kinds of meetings — I raised my hand and said
> “You know, isn’t it a problem that the contract that GE has with the
> Coalition Provisional Authority […] to rebuild the power generation
> system in Iraq [is] about the size of *the entire budget of NBC*? Is
> that kind of like the napkin rings thing?” And the standards people
> said “Huh. That’s interesting. No one’s brought that up before.” Now
> I’m not saying that I’m smart or that I’m advanced or that I’m ahead
> of my colleagues or maybe I had a lot of free time to think about this
> or maybe I’m some pinko-proto-lefty like Richard Nixon. I don’t know!
> But the fact that it drew a complete blank among the NBC standards
> people was interesting to me.
>
> [Now] in fact what happens in the networks — and you can find this at
> ABC and other networks at well — is that this [conflict with the
> profit motive] manifests itself [as journalists saying] “Well, we are
> better reporters because we deal with these kinds of conflicts all the
> time. And because we deal with those and we *always* decide in favor
> of the audience, it sort of exercises our journalistic muscle.” And
> this is the line you get from all of the entities.
>
> You may or may not be aware that there was a real strong full-court

At one of them, Hockenberry explains, a well-known pollster told about a
briefing he gave to all the senior officials at the White House about
how the polling data from the Arab world showed that America’s negatives
were simply off-the-charts. Everyone was quiet. Condi asked a few
technical questions and then finally Karl Rove spoke up. “Well, that’s
just until we start throwing our weight around over there,” he said.

Hockenberry was stunned and thought they should do a piece on what this
revealed into the mentality of the war’s planners. But NBC News didn’t
think this was a very good idea. America wanted the war to happen; their
job was just to wait and see how it turned out. “We’re not particularly
interested in the story,” Hockenberry explains. “We’re a process that’s
trying to maintain people in front of the set, so in a certain sense
media at that point was doing its own kind of shock-and-awe that went
right along with the war’s shock-and-awe [because] the business is just
to grab eyeballs.”

Later, his team edited together a montage of clips about what it was
like for reporters who were still in Iraq to experience the
shock-and-awe campaign. Vibrant images, narrated by a tense reporter who
was on the ground at the time.

> And the standards person goes — and again, this is his job, I don’t
> begrudge him that — he goes, “Seems like, seems like she has a point

>
> The table was silent. Just dead silent. And I was infuriated. But

> And there is something that I could say that would be right — and also

The piece aired.
