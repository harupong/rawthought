<p>(in no particular order)</p>

<p><strong>The Wonk Wing:</strong> Thoughtful exploration of important policy issues by decent writers who are clearly fascinated by their subject. Not only would you get a first-class education in the relevant issues around health care, global warming, urban sprawl, zoning, traffic, sewage, etc. but you&rsquo;d have fun while doing it. Think <a href="http://ezraklein.com/">Ezra Klein</a> for more than just health care. Think <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/">The Wonk Room</a> but more Sorkin and less Pennebaker. (Sorry, Wonk Room!)</p>

<p><strong>Perfect Devices:</strong> Coverage of things which are simply the best-in-the-world at what they do, and the stories of how they got there. I want stories from the people who calibrate bathroom-mirror lighting to be the perfect combination of brightness and diffusion &ldquo;so that it&rsquo;s diagnostically acute without being brutal&rdquo; (ASFTINDA, 302). I want stories about the kitchen at <em>French Laundry</em> and <em>Alinea</em>. I want the start-to-finish story of HF&amp;J designing a typeface. (Yes, I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting <em><a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/">Objectified</a></em>.)</p>

<p><strong>17th and Pennsylvania:</strong> This is the address of the Starbucks outside the White House, where apparently executive branch officials regularly grab coffee, chat, and meet with a wide variety of famous-for-DC types. Why doesn&rsquo;t an enterprising Gawker Stalker simply sit there and write down what happens?</p>

<p><strong>This Academic Life:</strong> Stories of new papers and research results &mdash; not just a summary of the work itself, but the story of how it fits into the field&rsquo;s debates, the personal intrigues of the players, the implications for the wider world. Basically, <em>Lingua Fraca</em> returning as a blog.</p>

<p><strong>Evisceration Quarterly:</strong> A daily selection of the finest in insults, takedowns, and general argumentative <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/evisceration">evisceration</a>. The motto: teaching you how to think by showing you how not to. And, to not be entirely negative, the occasional model of clarity. With special blogging consultant, Brad DeLong.</p>
