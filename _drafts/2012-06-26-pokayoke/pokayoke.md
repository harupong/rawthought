I’ve put together a new guide for developing software, from idea to
architectural details. The idea was to combine all the good ideas I’d
heard from various areas of software development into a single, concise
document. I’ve also added some new stuff — I think my need/idea model is
actually a pretty good way to generate startup (and other) ideas.

I’m eager for suggestions and feedback.
