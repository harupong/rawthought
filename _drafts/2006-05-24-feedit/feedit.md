Introducing feeds.reddit

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on another new project. I
think it’s finally time to tell people about it and what better place to
start then here? So here’s the site:

[feeds.reddit.com](http://feeds.reddit.com/)

The idea is that it’s a more social web feed (RSS) reader. First, it’s
got a great interface for reading feeds over the Internet — it has key
commands ([see the faq](http://feeds.reddit.com/faq)) that let you
easily breeze through stories while keeping track of what you’ve read
and haven’t read. Then there’s a simple URL you can go to any time,
anywhere (I visit it from my phone) to see stories you haven’t read yet.

Second, just like on reddit, you can vote on items you like a lot. This
will go towards creating a list of the most popular items but it will
also train a recommendations system to try to find other items and other
feeds that you’ll probably like as well.

The problem is that building this stuff up requires users. So I hope
you’ll [try it out](http://feeds.reddit.com/). It’s got one-click import
from Bloglines and imports OPML files from any other feed reader, so
there’s no harm in trying it out.
