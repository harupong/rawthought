How bizarre a book is *The Enemy At Home*, Dinesh D’Souza’s new screed
insisting the left is responsible for Islamic extremism? Pretty bizarre.
The book’s argument, [according to the
*Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/books/06kaku.html?ex=1328418000&en=8b6559c4b74d4d22&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss)
is that “1) that the American left is allied to the Islamic radical
movement to undermine the Bush White House and American foreign policy;
and 2) that ‘the left is the primary reason for Islamic
anti-Americanism…’ because ‘liberals defend and promote values that are
controversial in America and deeply revolting to people in traditional
societies, especially in the Muslim world.’”

Follow that? The left is allies with Islamic extremists because the
extremists hate the left. Just like Dinesh D’Souza. “[W]hen it comes to
core beliefs,” he writes, “I’d have to confess that I’m closer to the
dignified fellow in the long robe and prayer beads than to the slovenly
fellow with the baseball cap [Michael Moore].”

In other words, it sounds like the right is allied with Islamic
extremists in hating the liberal elements of American culture. What to
do about this is left as an exercise to the reader.
