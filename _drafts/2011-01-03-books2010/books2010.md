Unlinked means I recommend against getting it. Linked and italicized
means it’s actively recommended. Linked but not italicized is somewhere
in between. The ordering is not entirely accurate.

1.  *[Secrets](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670030309)* by Daniel
    Ellsberg

    A fantastic book. Ellsberg turns out to be an incredible writer and
    he tells not only his own incredible story of the fight to release
    the Pentagon Papers (did you know the *New York Times* actually
    stole them from his house?), but, even more interestingly, recounts
    a great deal of fascinating personal experience about what it was
    like working with McNamara and Kissinger and trying to maintain your
    sanity in the highest levels of government.

    With the WikiLeaks cables in the news, this book is more relevant
    than ever. And personally, I can’t wait until Ellsberg’s next book,
    *The American Doomsday Machine*, comes out. ([Here’s an
    excerpt](http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/09/11_ellsberg_hundred_holocausts.php)
    from back when he planned to publish it online; since then
    [Bloomsbury snapped it
    up](http://andyrossagency.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/daniel-ellsberg-and-the-american-doomsday-machine-2/).)

    Also, be sure to check out [these
    comments](http://crookedtimber.org/2009/12/22/i-dont-mind-who-writes-the-laws-of-the-future-if-i-can-write-and-sing-the-theme-tune/)
    from Davies and Galbraith.

2.  [Bright-Sided](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B003P2VDC4) by Barbara
    Ehrenreich

    A principled opposition to positive thinking has always been a
    common Ehrenreich theme and here she expands it to book-length,
    delivering exactly what you’d expect. The good news is that it’s
    trenchant and witty, the bad news is that if you read a lot of
    Ehrenreich you probably know just what’s coming.

3.  [Scientist in the Crib](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0688177883) by
    Allison Gopnik, Andrew N. Meltzoff, Patricia K. Kuhl

    Gopnik et al. summarize the findings of their wave of infant
    research — namely that infants are trying to puzzle things out
    through experiments rather than just sitting there waiting for their
    brains to grow. Gopnik, as you’d expect, is a good writer, but their
    attempts to link their research with philosophy are a bit strained
    and the research is still weak enough that the book doesn’t quite
    feel like it pays off the title.

4.  Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely

    Everybody’s reading it, but that doesn’t mean you have to. A
    collection of fairly mundane behavioral psychology experiments. If
    you’re really so deluded as to believe people aren’t predictably
    irrational, it’s not clear to me how a mere book could possibly help
    you.

5.  *[A Bee Stung Me So I Killed All The
    Fish](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/static/abeestungme.pdf)* [PDF] by
    George Saunders

    I love Saunders. I read [pretty much everything he’s
    written](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/User:AaronSw/George_Saunders)
    this year. This collection features some of his sillier pieces.

6.  [The Braindead Megaphone](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159448256X) by
    George Saunders

    Saunders is great, but he hasn’t quite honed his nonfiction talents
    the way he has with his fiction. Some fantastic pieces, some
    fascinating ones, and some that don’t quite work.

7.  *[Prince of the Marshes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B002V1GZFK)* by
    Rory Stewart

    I occasionally have this fantasy, while reading the news, that
    whatever person I’m reading about has been fired and, through some
    miraculous fluke, I have been given their job. Would I make a hash
    of it? Or, would by naive mind and outsider’s expertise allow me to
    do it in a fascinating new way?

    In this book, Rory Stewart describes what happened when he was made
    a colonial governor of a province in Iraq. Brilliant fellow that he
    is, he does a remarkably good job all things considered, but also
    writes a questioning, soul-searching, fascinating book about the
    experience that highlights what an impossible task it really is.

8.  *[False Profits: Recovering from the Bubble
    Economy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0982417128)* by Dean Baker

    A short, clear book on why the economy failed, who did it, and how
    to set it right by someone who was absolutely right about it all
    along. If you only want to read one book about the economic crisis,
    this would be an excellent choice.

9.  *[The Accidental Theorist](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393318877)*
    by Paul Krugman

    A collection of Krugman’s columns for *Slate*. It was before he
    really came off his neoliberal high, but after he learned to write,
    so while they’re not always right they’re almost always delightful
    (and *Slate* gave him a lot more freedom to be playful than the
    *Times* does). A very fun book about a wide range of issues in
    economics. (Here’s [a nice
    review](http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/econ_articles/reviews/krugman_accidental.html)
    from Brad DeLong.)

10. [The Political Brain](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586485733) by
    Drew Westen

    A decent book that could have been great if it had a real editor.
    There are really three things in here: 1) some fantastic examples of
    what Democrats *should* say if they have any spine (they’re the kind
    of political propaganda Lakoff would write if Lakoff could write
    political propaganda), 2) some pretty bogus fMRI experiments to give
    the text in (1) the illusion of being backed in hard science, 3)
    several hundred pages of pointless rambling and repetition. If only
    an editor could have at least removed (3).

11. *[Get Out The Vote](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0815732678)* by
    Donald Green and Alan Gerber

    Every year, thousands of Americans head out onto the streets to
    knock on their neighbors’ doors and remind them to vote. Does any of
    it have any effect? Green and Gerber had the bright idea of running
    an experiment to see: Randomize the houses and ask the canvassers to
    knock on half of them and ignore the other half. Then, check the
    voting records (which are public) to see how many people in each
    group voted. The difference can tell you if you made a difference.

    This brilliant idea sparked a whole field of experimental research
    about getting out the vote, which Green and Gerber summarize in this
    short book, aimed at some mix of scientists and political
    professionals.

12. *[Eating the Dinosaur](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416544216)* by
    Chuck Klosterman

    Absolutely fantastic. Could hardly put it down. Chuck Klosterman is
    definitely in the running for greatest living essayist. The book is
    a collection of essays, but not, as far as I can tell, essays that
    were ever published anywhere else. They’re each just magical gems
    that fit together just perfectly. I even liked the stuff about
    football (and I’ve never seen a game of football).

    I liked this so much I went on to read all his other books in
    reverse chronological order:

13. [Chuck Klosterman IV](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743284895) by
    Chuck Klosterman

    Great, but not quite *as* great.

14. [Killing Yourself in Order to
    Live](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743264460) by Chuck Klosterman

    Merely interesting.

15. [Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa
    Puffs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743236017) by Chuck Klosterman

    Pretty good.

    But I could not read either *Downtown Owl* (his novel) or *Fargo
    Rock City*. The rest I couldn’t put down. I guess start with *Eating
    the Dinosaur* and see how far you get.

16. [Doubt is Their Product](http://books.theinfo.org/go/019530067X) by
    David Michaels

    There are a vast array of government agencies, like the EPA and
    OSHA, whose job is to protect Americans by examining the science and
    outlawing things that hurt people. But what if the bad guys get to
    make up the science? David Michaels examines the whole industry of
    scientists-for-hire that try to manufacture doubt about the harms
    that big business commits. The title comes from a tobacco company
    memo and the tobacco companies are infamous for trying to shed doubt
    on the studies attacking their products, but the tactics they
    invented have now spread to every little chemical additive.

    Michaels is now head of OSHA. On the one hand, it’s great that such
    a corporate critic has such an influential position. On the other
    hand, this book is written in the style you’d expect from someone
    who could become head of OSHA: it’s cautious, not polemical, and
    obsessed with proving the details, rather than the bigger picture.

17. *[Why Not Socialism?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691143617)* by
    G.A. Cohen

    A great little book from the late philosopher Jerry Cohen. Not quite
    as great as [his comments about the
    shmoos](http://crookedtimber.org/2009/08/06/jerry-cohen-a-personal-appreciation/),
    but a wonderful (and, sadly, all too rare) attempt to get people
    thinking about what socialism really means and whether it would be
    practical.

18. [Free Schools](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2933773W/Free_schools)
    by Jonathan Kozol

    An angry little book not about how bad the school system is, like
    Kozol’s usual beat, but about the people trying to change it. Both
    the folks, like Kozol, going into the inner city and trying to start
    new schools and the others running away to the land to frolic in
    freedom. Certainly a time capsule from the 1970s, but a fascinating
    one.

19. [Making Movies](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0679756604) by Sidney
    Lumet

    A fairly self-absorbed book about what it means to make a movie.
    Some decent details about the practicalities in here, but mixed in
    with a lot of random musing and personal reflection.

20. *[The Persistence of
    Poverty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0300151365)* by Charles Karelis

    I feel like I’ve written so much about this book, but none of it
    appears to have made it to this blog. A great little book, just
    enough to explain one big idea and how it overturns what you think
    about classical economics and poverty and much else besides. Here’s
    [a quick
    bit](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2009/12/the-persistence-of-poverty/)
    from Matt Yglesias on it.

21. Caught Between Two Worlds: The Diary of a Lowell Mill Girl

22. Mill by David Macaulay

    I don’t understand why everyone loves Macaulay so.

23. Belles of New England

24. *[The Industrial Worker](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0929587251)* by
    Norman Ware

    A fascinating history about how mill girls and shoemakers invented
    socialism and fought for it in the early days of the republic,
    before Jefferson’s dream of independent men was crushed by the
    onslaught of industrialization.

25. *[Acme Novelty Library,
    \#19](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1897299567)* by Chris Ware

    Chris Ware is magic. This book consists mostly of a chapter from the
    work-in-progress *Rusty Brown*, which I was initially skeptical
    about, but turns out to be just amazingly great. And *Building
    Stories* is incredible too.

    Ware’s method is to publish a page each week or so in a weekly paper
    (the Sunday *New York Times*, the *Chicago Reader*), then redraw the
    entire chapter and send it out as an edition of the *Novelty
    Library*, then redraw it a third time when the entire book is
    published. So this is a way of getting intermediate results, but you
    could just wait for the final books themselves (if they are ever
    finished).

26. [The Art of Lobbying](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0872894622) by
    Bertram Levine

    A guide by a practitioner, for practitioners. Not great, but you can
    pick up a little bit of the flavor of the job from reading what the
    insiders say.

27. *[Making the Social World: The Structure of Human
    Civilization](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195396170)* by John
    Searle

    Brilliant. [My review is
    here](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dirfas).

28. [The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies
    Stronger](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B004A14W0Y) by Wilkinson and
    Pickett

    Not as good as I was hoping, but still a compelling case for
    equality with a vast array of data.

29. Women at Work

30. [Loom and Spindle](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1176813617) by
    Harriet Jane Hanson Robinson

    A fantastic memoir of a fantastic time. Shows how radical even the
    moderate mill girls were.

31. *[Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value and How to Take Advantage of
    It](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809078813)* by William Poundstone

    Poundstone is one of the great science writers of all time. Here he
    takes on behavioral economics at the very top of his game. Full of
    fascinating ideas.

32. [Influence](http://books.theinfo.org/go/006124189X) by Robert
    Cialdini

    Covers the usual results of the science on persuasion in a decent
    and clear way.

33. [Education and the Cult of
    Efficiency](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226091503) by Raymond E.
    Callahan

    Proof that business has been trying to take over education for over
    a century.

34. [On Writing](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1439156816) by Stephen King

    Nothing earth-shattering, but it turns out Stephen King is actually
    a good writer. I honestly had no idea.

35. *[Schooling in Capitalist
    America](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465097189)* (reread) by Samuel
    Bowles and Herbert Gintis

    The best book on the real meaning of school.

36. *[Becoming Attached](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)*
    (reread) by Robert Karen

    One of my favorite books of all time. Probably the best work of
    science writing I’ve ever read.

37. *[Moral Politics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226467716)* (reread)
    by George Lakoff

    The best book on American politics.

38. *[Unconditional Parenting](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743487486)*
    (reread) by Alfie Kohn

39. *[How Children Fail](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201484021)*
    (reread) by John Holt

    An amazing book on education.

40. [The Lobbyists](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0812923146) by Jeffrey
    Birnbaum

41. [Dumbing Us Down](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0865714487) by John
    Taylor Gatto

42. [Winning Your Election the Wellstone
    Way](http://books.theinfo.org/go/081665333X) by Jeff Blodgett and
    Bill Lofy and others

    Really just a more-detailed version of *Politics the Wellstone Way*.

43. *[Bonfire of the Vanities](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312427573)*
    by Tom Wolfe

    Absolutely fantastic. A rare must-read novel — packed full of
    information about society, journalism, activism, race, etc. I can’t
    convey just how good it really is. It’s like *The Power Broker* of
    fiction.

44. [The Checklist Manifesto](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312430000) by
    Atul Gawande

    Not a bad book by any means, but its constrained focus means it’s
    not quite as thrilling as Gawande’s other books. It ends up mostly
    being a series of stories about how great checklists can be.
    Checklists are interesting, but they’re a very small piece of the
    institutional change that this book should really be about. You get
    a few hints at other pieces through the well-researched examples,
    but they’re only hints.

45. The Revisionists Revised by Diane Ravitch

    Eminently skimmable — Ravitch barely even tries to mount an
    argument. Instead she just sort of fumes for a hundred pages or so
    at the radical scholars who dared to point out the invention of
    school wasn’t so nobly motivated. Well, she’s come a long way — now
    she’s basically one of them. ([See this piece on her
    reversal](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/thewrongstuff/archive/2010/05/17/diane-ravitch-on-being-wrong.aspx).)

46. [Free at Last: The Sudbury Valley
    School](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1888947004) by Daniel Greenberg

    Sudbury has some aspects of magic and nothing conveys them better
    than this book.

47. [Learning all the Time](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201550911) by
    John Holt

48. [Political Polling](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0742561313) by
    Jeffrey Stonecash

    Has some decent stuff on the business side of things — how to write
    polling reports and get clients and so on.

49. [The Big Short](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393338827) by Michael
    Lewis

    Oh, what to say about this book? It’s well-written, as you’d expect,
    though no knockout. It tells a fascinating story about some aspects
    of the crisis, but goes far from unravelling the whole thing.

50. *[How to Win Friends and Influence
    People](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1439167346)* (reread) by Dale
    Carnegie

    There’s a reason this is a classic. It articulates a way of dealing
    with people, founded on concern and empathy, and convincingly argues
    that this kind style is actually the more productive one for getting
    things done. Instead of yelling at people to do things, you make
    them *want* to help you. And the book itself is a genius exemplar of
    this practice. Instead of berating you for being a jerk, like most
    people would, it persuades you to *want* to change.

51. *[The Immortal Life of Henrietta
    Lacks](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400052173)* by Rebecca Skloot

    Everyone has praised this book, and for good reason — it deftly
    interweaves an incredible story of science with the heartbreaking
    tragedy of the people science studies. Nothing earthshattering, but
    a great piece of writing.

52. [The Design of Design](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0201362988) by
    Fred Brooks

    No deep lasting insights, but it is fascinating to watch Brooks
    struggle with these questions and it helps you struggle as well.

53. [REDACTED]

54. [The Case Against Standardized
    Tests](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0325008930) by Alfie Kohn

    If you need more reasons to hate standardized tests, this book is
    full of them.

55. [When You Were a Tadpole and I Was a
    Fish](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374532419) by Martin Gardner

    In memoriam. In the same way that the spirit of Lenny Bruce passed
    through Bill Hicks and now Louis CK, the ghost of Feynman passed to
    Martin Gardner. His wit and curiosity, combined with a gift for
    explanation, did more than almost anyone to promote a genuine
    appreciation for math and science. This essay collection was his
    last book. (Although I’m sure many, many more will come
    posthumously.)

56. [Class War?: What Americans Really Think about Economic
    Inequality](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226644553) by Benjamin Page
    and Lawrence Jacobs

    If the state of politics gets you down about your fellow man, this
    well-researched scientific book will persuade you that even
    Americans are egalitarians at heart.

57. [Getting to Yes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140157352) by Roger
    Fisher and William Ury

    This book is full of alternate strategies to try, but has very
    little on the key negotiation question of what to do about
    distributing the surplus.

58. [Expert Political Judgment](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691128715)
    by Philip Tetlock

    This book is kind of a bore to read, but the story it tells is
    fascinating, so [just read Louis Menand’s
    summary](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1)
    instead.

59. [101 Things I Learned in Business
    School](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446550280) by Michael W. Preis
    with Matthew Frederick

    A sweet, short book with cute pictures. Smart idea for a series.

60. [The Way We Were?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/087078417X)
    [[online](http://tcf.org/publications/1998/9/pb196)] by Richard
    Rothstein

    A fantastic debunking of the “kids were so much smarter back then”
    myth.

61. [The Matthew Effect](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231149484) by
    Daniel Rigney

    Short and unmemorable.

62. [Taking Economic Seriously](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262014181)
    by Dean Baker

    A nice little summary of Dean’s big ideas.

63. *[The Meaning of David
    Cameron](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1846944562)* by Richard Seymour

    A short book on what’s happened to British politics from a radical
    perspective.

64. *[Managing to Change the
    World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0615273416)* by Allison Green and
    Jerry Hauser

    The best book on the practicalities of management I’ve ever read.
    Whereas most books focus on vague and meaningless advice, this book
    is clear about the nuts and bolts.

65. *[Workers in a Labyrinth](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0876638175)*
    by Robert Jackall

    Not as great as my favorite book of all-time, Jackall’s *Moral
    Mazes*, but a fascinating look at how normal people make sense of
    their daily work lives.

66. Disconnect by Morris Fiorina

    Fiorina has no idea what he’s talking about in this one; it’s
    completely ridiculous. There was a long period in American politics
    where, to prevent blacks from voting, southern whites excluded
    blacks from the Democratic party primary and then always voted for
    the Democratic nominee in the general. Blacks could legally vote,
    but only in the general, when it didn’t make any difference.

    The result was that a whole lot of racist, conservative politicians
    ended up in the Democratic Party and so politics appeared less
    polarized — there were conservatives Democrats (and some liberal
    Republicans) and the conservatives and the liberals could work
    “across party lines” to get things done.

    Eventually the Supreme Court outlawed this noxious practice and the
    south started sending Republicans to Congress instead. That led to
    the conservatives leaving the Democratic party (and then the liberal
    Republicans getting kicked out too) and now when liberals or
    conservatives all work together, they only need to do so within one
    party. The result is what appears to be an increase in party
    polarization. Instead of a couple Democratic liberals and a couple
    Republican liberals writing a bill, you just get a bunch of
    Democratic liberals writing a bill.

    This is such an obvious explanation and MoFi does his best to ignore
    it, looking everywhere but the obvious place so he can wonder about
    the dangers of polarization.

67. [The Girl with the Dragon
    Tattoo](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0307454541) (1 of 3) by Stieg
    Larsson

    This book has no deep point to make, Nora Ephron has [ably
    chronicled its stylistic
    oddities](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2010/07/05/100705sh_shouts_ephron),
    and the plot is more bizarre than compelling. Yet I couldn’t put it
    down. Indeed, I dare say I enjoyed it.

68. [The Girl who Played with
    Fire](http://books.theinfo.org/go/030745455X) (2 of 3) by Stieg
    Larsson

69. [The Girl who Kicked Over the Hornet’s
    Nest](http://books.theinfo.org/go/030726999X) (3 of 3) by Stieg
    Larsson

    These two tell a different, and in some ways more interesting story
    than the first one, but it’s not enough to change my fundamental
    evaluation.

    However, I do much prefer the original titles, which translate
    roughly to: *Men Who Hate Women*, *The Girl Who Played with Fire*,
    and *The Exploding Social Safety Net*. I guess it’s nice when that
    sort of thing can be a bestseller.

70. *[The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who
    Read Them](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374532184)* by Elif Batuman

    Hilarious, brilliant, fantastic. There’s no justification for this
    book being as good as it is. Even I wasn’t interested in reading a
    book about Russian literary scholars, but it’s just incredible good
    and I’m glad I did.

71. *[This is Your Country on
    Drugs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0470643897)* by Ryan Grim

    I would not have thought the world needed another book on drugs, but
    this one turns out to be basically perfect. Comprehensive, erudite,
    funny, and realistic — Grim definitely inhales.

72. [Scott Pilgrim’s Precious Little
    Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664084) (1 of 6) by Bryan Lee
    O’Malley

73. [Scott Pilgrim vs. The
    World](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664122) (2 of 6) by Bryan Lee
    O’Malley
74. [Scott Pilgrim and the Infinite
    Sadness](http://books.theinfo.org/go/193266422X) (3 of 6) by Bryan
    Lee O’Malley
75. [Scott Pilgrim Gets It
    Together](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932664491) (4 of 6) by Bryan
    Lee O’Malley
76. [Scott Pilgrim vs. The
    Universe](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1934964107) (5 of 6) by Bryan
    Lee O’Malley
77. [Scott Pilgrim’s Finest
    Hour](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1934964387) (6 of 6) by Bryan Lee
    O’Malley

    You should *definitely* see the movie and then, if you do see it,
    it’s worth reading the books. The books are much deeper and darker
    than the movie otherwise lets on. You realize that the film you saw
    as an example of joy and exuberance is actually incredibly
    depressing.

    By contrast, we will just forget that someone made a movie of
    *Bonfire of the Vanities*. Yeek.

78. Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

79. *[Delivering Happiness](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446563048)* by
    Tony Hsieh

    This book is more the story of Hsieh’s insane journey toward
    creating Zappos than the business advice book it looks like, but
    that’s OK because it’s an incredible story and Hsieh’s exuberant
    retelling makes it impossible to put down.

80. [Meta Math!](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400077974) by Gregory
    Chaitin

    Chaitin makes an obscure field you’ve never heard of like
    Algorithmic Information Theory sound interesting and fun, even if
    you don’t know any math.

81. [Philosophy in a New
    Century](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521731585) by John Searle

    A collection of some great essays by Searle.

82. The Essential Drucker by Peter Drucker

    Drucker sounds like the kind of person I should like, but I’ve never
    actually liked him.

83. Socks by Beverly Cleary

84. Beezus and Ramona by Beverly Cleary
85. Ramona the Pest by Beverly Cleary
86. Ramona the Brave by Beverly Cleary

    I read these to the seven-year-old, at her insistence. They weren’t
    great, but they were at least tolerable, unlike some of the other
    stuff she likes.

87. XKCD, vol. 0 by Randall Munroe

    You no doubt already read xkcd online. Yet apparently many people
    also bought this paper copy. And they said print was dead!

88. [The Promise: President Obama, Year
    One](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1847398065) by Jonathan Alter

    No great revelations, but it is shocking how little actual thought
    goes on in the Obama White House.

89. *[Microeconomics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691126380)* by Samuel
    Bowles

    A textbook that totally upends the field of classical economics.
    Sadly, it can be a bit hard to follow, but I wrote [summaries of it
    here](http://groups.google.com/group/bowles-l/topics).

90. *[All Art is Propaganda: Critical
    Essays](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0156033070)* by George Orwell
    (with introduction by Keith Gessen)

    Orwell is magic.

91. [Toyota Production System](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0915299143)
    by Taiichi Ohno

    It’s hard to find a better book that describes what lean production,
    in its original sense, is all about than this translated work from
    its creator. I hope that Ohno one day gets the recognition he
    deserves: as one of the world’s first pioneers in what is
    undoubtedly the greatest human art form (with sex running a close
    second).

92. [Freedom](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312600844) by Jonathan
    Franzen

    Flashes of greatness mixed with strings of ridiculousness. (This is
    Franzen’s Great American Novel, in case you hadn’t heard.) Could
    have been truly great if Franzen had a great editor, but instead all
    his indulgences were left in. It’s certainly no competition for DFW.
    (Sorry, Franzen!)

93. [The Machine that Changed the World: The Story of Lean
    Production—Toyota’s Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now
    Revolutionizing World
    Industry](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743299795) by James P.
    Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel Roos

    Not bad, but feels a bit like reading a book by a bunch of blind men
    trying to explain the elephant charging toward them.

94. Conscience of a Liberal by Paul Krugman

    Did I really read this book? I don’t remember it at all.

95. [How to Become a Scandal](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805089799) by
    Laura Kipnis

    Kipnis’ writing is fun, as always, but there’s no real insight here.

96. [Poisoned for Pennies: The Economics of Toxics and
    Precaution](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1597264016) by Frank
    Ackerman

    A fantastic book on the serious trouble with using mathematical
    cost-benefit analyses to try to decide when to protect the
    environment.

97. Exit, Voice, and Loyalty by Albert O. Hirschman

    A disappointment. Perhaps all its insights have become common
    knowledge since then.

98. REDACTED

99. [Beyond the Hoax](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0199561834) by Alan
    Sokal

    Alan Sokal returns again with a book collecting and integrating his
    papers on the philosophy of science (although there is still some
    repetition). Sokal’s clear thinking on difficult philosophical
    issues is always appreciated, but this time around I’m convinced
    that [he’s wrong about the Edinburgh
    set](http://qblog.aaronsw.com/post/1153051459/edinburgh-revisited).
    The rest of it is great, though, especially if you haven’t read it
    before. (There’s also some good newish stuff too, including some
    stuff about *Prophets Facing Backward*.)

100. *[Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective
    Joy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805057242)* by Barbara Ehrenreich

    Ehrenreich makes a convincing case for the ecstatic tradition in
    American life. My only regret is that it lacks a chapter on raves.

101. [The Mind-Body Problem](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140172459) by
    Rebecca Goldstein

    A nice book about the problem with marrying a genius. See also: the
    film *Whatever Works*.

102. REDACTED

103. [The \$12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of
    Contemporary Art](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0230620590) by Don
    Thompson

    This is another book about a weird subject that goes into too much
    detail. Thompson gives a decent overview of the art market, but then
    spends too much time getting into obscure detail about the people
    involved. Modern art sure is weird, though.

104. [The Cartoon Introduction to
    Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809094819) by Grady Klein
    and Yoram Bauman

    Funny (especially the intro) and some basic economics, but nothing
    stupendous on either front.

105. *[When Brute Force Fails](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691148643)*
    by Mark A. R. Kleiman

    A fantastic book. More gushing [in my
    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bruteforce).

106. [Money for Nothing](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1416597700) by John
    Gillespie and David Zweig

    A quick read on why corporate boards suck so very much.

107. [Ha’Penny](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0765358085) (2 of 3) by Jo
    Walton

108. [Half a Crown](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0765316218) (3 of 3) by
    Jo Walton

    A good fun detective story combined with interesting speculative
    fiction. (I read the first book, *Farthing*, years ago.)

109. [Reason and Rationality](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691139008) by
    Jon Elster

    Very, very short.

110. [An Object of Beauty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0446573647) by
    Steve Martin

    More on the art market. Martin is not a bad novelist, considering
    everything else he is, but I doubt I would have read the book if it
    had a different author’s name on the cover.

111. [Shopgirl](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0786891076) by Steve Martin

    Turns out to be basically the same book, except much creepier since
    you realize Martin’s basically just using the book to work through
    his guilt about screwing over younger women.

112. *[Good to Great](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0066620996)* by Jim
    Collins

    Most business books consist of a bunch of wacky ideas dressed up
    with even wackier names and presented as the Next Big Thing. Jim
    Collins greatly improves the genre, by replacing the wacky ideas
    with actual science. (Unfortunately, he continues the tradition of
    wacky names.)

    Collins and his team picked out all Fortune 500 companies that
    sustained 4x market returns for more than 15 years (the great
    companies) and went back to find the transition point where they
    went from earning normal-market returns to their 4x returns. Then
    they found the most similar company at that transition point and
    used it as a control. They examined what differed between the great
    companies and the controls and describe it here. Of course, you have
    to trust Collins to pick out the right lessons, but the ones he
    chooses seem like very good ones.

113. [Good to Great and the Social
    Sector](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0977326403) by Jim Collins

    A short little appendix describing how to apply these principles to
    non-profits.

114. [Built to Last](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060516402) by Jim
    Collins and Jerry Porras

    This book is very similar to *Good to Great* except it uses even
    worse science and even worse names. (Clock building? Really? Can’t
    we just call it institution building?) Just read *Good to Great* —
    the important stuff from this book is presented in its last chapter
    anyway.

115. Beyond Entrepreneurship by Jim Collins and William C. Lazier

    This book has pretty much no science (although fewer silly names as
    well). It’s just a lazier version of *Built to Last*.

116. [You Lost Me There](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1594487634) by
    Rosencrans Baldwin

    I knew Rosencrans had a novel out, but I was shocked to see it at
    the checkout counter. But it’s great!

117. Bigfoot: I Not Dead by Graham Roumieu

    Not funny.

118. [The Thick of It: The Missing DoSAC
    Files](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0571272541) by the writers of
    *The Thick of It*

    Not that funny. (*The Thick of It* is one of the top 5 great TV
    shows of all-time, though.)

119. *[The Lifecycle of Software
    Objects](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1596063173)*
    [[online](http://subterraneanpress.com/index.php/magazine/fall-2010/fiction-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects-by-ted-chiang/)]
    by Ted Chiang

    Read it! Even people who know much more about sci-fi than me agree
    this is one of the great science fiction books of all time. It’s a
    novel about the ethical issues with AI.

120. [Dr. Horrible and Other Horrible
    Stories](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1595825770) by Zack Whedon

    Definitely funny, though not as great as the show.

121. [Wrestling With Moses](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400066743) by
    Anthony Flint

    A decent attempt at a biography of Jane Jacobs, though I would have
    wanted more detail on how she actually did what she did. Caro he is
    not — either in writing or research.

122. *[Short: Walking Tall When You’re Not Tall At
    All](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159643323X)* by John Schwartz

    Surely you’ve heard about the studies showing short people don’t
    make as much as tall people. John Schwartz set out to write a book
    to cheer kids up about this fact, but looking into them he found it
    wasn’t a fact at all. The result is a model of self-help through
    science and media criticism. Schwartz playfully teaches you enough
    math and science to be able to debunk the studies and enough
    personal advice to make a life on your own terms.

*Disclosures:* I know Rory Stewart, Dean Baker, John Schwartz, Ryan
Grim, Randall Munroe, and Charles Karelis. Baker and Karelis provided me
with free copies. Ryan Grim and John Schwartz have written about me in
other forums.

In the future, I think I should probably do this monthly instead of one
huge yearly installment.
