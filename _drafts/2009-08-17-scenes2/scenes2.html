<p>After a long delay, we&rsquo;re finally allowed to board the plane. As we wait in line, the businessman in front of me takes out his phone and makes a call. &ldquo;Hi, honey,&rdquo; he says, apparently leaving a message. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only boarding the plane just now, so I&rsquo;ll probably be about an hour late. See you then.&rdquo; He hangs up the phone and then dials again. &ldquo;Hi, honey,&rdquo; he says, in a similar voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only boarding the plane just now, so I&rsquo;ll probably be an hour and forty minutes late. See you then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man paces his apartment in a robe. He lives on the penthouse suite of a modern residential building in an industrial section of Manhattan. He has the whole top floor; the elevator opens right into his apartment. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s left the place in days; for food, he orders delivery and pays at the elevator door. &ldquo;Can you get me some pot?&rdquo; he asks. He&rsquo;s desperate for it. I give him a piece of paper with the number for a coke delivery service &mdash; &ldquo;anytime, anywhere&rdquo;. &ldquo;Do you think they do weed too?&rdquo; he asks. A copy of <em>Infinite Jest</em> lies unopened by his bed.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a cafe across the street that has the world&rsquo;s most perfect corn muffins. But they only seem to stock just one each day. Every day, I carefully watch the clock: if I go there too early, I&rsquo;m not particularly hungry; if I go there too late, I find them out of corn muffins and leave empty-handed. Finding the right minute is a constant struggle.</p>

<p>Today I show up and, as usual, there&rsquo;s just one left. One clerk is getting it for me (I don&rsquo;t even have to ask anymore; the clerks all know I always get just the corn muffin) while another is taking the order of the woman next to me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the&mdash;oh, he got the last one,&rdquo; she says. She turns to me. &ldquo;You got the best muffin!&rdquo; She walks away empty-handed.</p>
