<h1>The Grim Meathook Future</h1>

<p>In the technology industry we have a phrase. We call it the &ldquo;grim meathook future&rdquo;, after <a href="http://www.zenarchery.com/index.php?p=962">a brilliant piece by Joshua Ellis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the problem is that the future, maybe for the first time since WWII, lies on the far side of an event horizon for us, <em>because</em> there are so many futures possible. There&rsquo;s the wetware future, the hardware future, the transhumanist future, the post-rationalist (aka fundamentalist) future.</p>
  
  <p>And then there&rsquo;s the future where everything just sort of keeps going on the way it has, with incremental changes, and technology is no longer the deciding factor in things. You don&rsquo;t need high tech to change the world; you need Semtex and guns that were designed by a Russian soldier fifty-odd years ago.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, most of the people with any genuine opportunity or ability to effect global change are too busy patting each other on the back at conventions and blue-skying goofy social networking tools that are essentially useless to 95% of the world&rsquo;s population, who live within fifteen feet of everyone they&rsquo;ve ever known and have no need to track their fuck buddies with GPS systems. (This, by the way, includes most Americans, quite honestly.)</p>
  
  <p>You can&rsquo;t blame them for this, because it&rsquo;s fun and it&rsquo;s a great way to travel and get paid, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually help solve any real problems, except the problem of media theory grad students, which the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t really interested in solving.</p>
  
  <p>Feeding poor people is useful tech, but it&rsquo;s not very sexy and it won&rsquo;t get you on the cover of <em>Wired</em>. Talk about it too much and you sound like an earnest hippie. So nobody wants to do that.</p>
  
  <p>They want to make cell phones that can scan your personal measurements and send them real-time to potential sex partners. Because, you know, the fucking Japanese teenagers love it, and Japanese teenagers are clearly the smartest people on the planet.</p>
  
  <p>The upshot of all of this is that the Future gets divided; the cute, insulated future that Joi Ito and Cory Doctorow and you and I inhabit, and the <strong>grim meathook future</strong> that most of the world is facing, in which they watch their squats and under-developed fields get turned into a giant game of Counterstrike between crazy faith-ridden jihadist motherfuckers and crazy faith-ridden American redneck motherfuckers, each doing their best to turn the entire world into one type of fascist nightmare or another.</p>
  
  <p>Of course, nobody really wants to talk about that future, because it&rsquo;s depressing and not fun and doesn&rsquo;t have Fischerspooner doing the soundtrack. So everybody pretends they don&rsquo;t know what the future holds, when the unfortunate fact is that &mdash; unless we start paying very serious attention &mdash; it holds what the past holds: a great deal of extreme boredom punctuated by occasional horror and the odd moment of grace.</p>
