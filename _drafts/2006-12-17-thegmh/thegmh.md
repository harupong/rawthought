In the technology industry we have a phrase. We call it the “grim
meathook future”, after [a brilliant piece by Joshua
Ellis](http://www.zenarchery.com/index.php?p=962):

> I think the problem is that the future, maybe for the first time since
> WWII, lies on the far side of an event horizon for us, *because* there
> are so many futures possible. There’s the wetware future, the hardware
> future, the transhumanist future, the post-rationalist (aka
> fundamentalist) future.
>
> And then there’s the future where everything just sort of keeps going
> on the way it has, with incremental changes, and technology is no
> longer the deciding factor in things. You don’t need high tech to
> change the world; you need Semtex and guns that were designed by a
> Russian soldier fifty-odd years ago.
>
> Meanwhile, most of the people with any genuine opportunity or ability
> to effect global change are too busy patting each other on the back at
> conventions and blue-skying goofy social networking tools that are
> essentially useless to 95% of the world’s population, who live within
> fifteen feet of everyone they’ve ever known and have no need to track
> their fuck buddies with GPS systems. (This, by the way, includes most
> Americans, quite honestly.)
>
> You can’t blame them for this, because it’s fun and it’s a great way
> to travel and get paid, but it doesn’t actually help solve any real
> problems, except the problem of media theory grad students, which the
> rest of the world isn’t really interested in solving.
>
> Feeding poor people is useful tech, but it’s not very sexy and it
> won’t get you on the cover of *Wired*. Talk about it too much and you
> sound like an earnest hippie. So nobody wants to do that.
>
> They want to make cell phones that can scan your personal measurements
> and send them real-time to potential sex partners. Because, you know,
> the fucking Japanese teenagers love it, and Japanese teenagers are
> clearly the smartest people on the planet.
>
> The upshot of all of this is that the Future gets divided; the cute,
> insulated future that Joi Ito and Cory Doctorow and you and I inhabit,
> and the **grim meathook future** that most of the world is facing, in
> which they watch their squats and under-developed fields get turned
> into a giant game of Counterstrike between crazy faith-ridden jihadist
> motherfuckers and crazy faith-ridden American redneck motherfuckers,
> each doing their best to turn the entire world into one type of
> fascist nightmare or another.
>
> Of course, nobody really wants to talk about that future, because it’s
> depressing and not fun and doesn’t have Fischerspooner doing the
> soundtrack. So everybody pretends they don’t know what the future
> holds, when the unfortunate fact is that — unless we start paying very
> serious attention — it holds what the past holds: a great deal of
> extreme boredom punctuated by occasional horror and the odd moment of
> grace.
