So I’m looking to hire a campaigner for my online progressive group.
What does a campaigner do? Well, the basic process looks like this:

1.  Read the news and look for a political fight that might interest
    people.

2.  Think of a way that ordinary people can get involved.

3.  Write an email briefly explaining the issue and persuading people to
    take action on it.

4.  Channel those actions into a wider impact, e.g. by informing the
    press, delivering petitions, running ads, etc.

People who might be a good fit for this include political bloggers, who
have a lot of experience with 1 and 3, and people who have run campaigns
on local issues, giving them experience with 2 and 4. It’s also helpful
if you have experience with web design and HTML.

But the most important thing is just being creative and persuasive and
passionate about the issues. Every campaign is different and each one
has to be run differently to seize people’s attention. Someone who can
think outside the box and try something new each time is going to be
more successful than someone who’s an expert at the standard way of
doing things.

Having done it myself, nothing competes with the thrill of running a
campaign. Instead of just getting upset about the news, you get to do
something about it. You get to rally people to action, explain the story
to the media, and really get into a fight with the bad guys. And every
once in a while you actually win a victory that improves the lives of
millions of people. It’s ridiculously exciting, fun, and rewarding.

If you’re interested, send a resume and a short note persuading me to
take some action to [me@aaronsw.com](mailto:me@aaronsw.com) with
“campaigner” in the subject.
