*Charlie Brooker begins his recent BBC4 show*
[Newswipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newswipe_with_Charlie_Brooker)
*with this speech. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t quite live up to
these ambitions, being basically a version of* [Charlie Brooker’s
Screenwipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brooker%27s_Screenwipe)
*focused on the news, but they seem like the right ambitions to me.*

> Back in 1919, when I was a kid and my throat was less sore, I always
> assumed adults knew what was what. So imagine my horror, on growing
> up, to discover that actually we’re all just winging it. As adults,
> there’s a whole range of things you’re supposed to ‘know about’ and
> ‘have opinions on’: everything from what wine to serve at your twatty
> dinner party through to what’s going on in the world of ‘current
> affairs’.
>
> Yes, it turns out you were supposed to be paying attention to the news
> all this time. Although the chances are you haven’t, at least not
> really. I mean, when were you meant to start? When you’re a kid, the
> news is effectively out of bounds. It’s a program aimed at adults
> that’s either impenetrably boring (‘the economy minister for the
> economy today said interest rates were discombobulating the trade
> union a—’) or downright terrifying (‘murdered horses and terrorists
> today said that you and your mummy and daddy are certain to die in a
> global ap—’).
>
> Anyway, the end result is that you ignore the news for years and then
> suddenly, somewhere down the line when you’re a bit older, there’s
> comes a point when you realize you’re completely bloody ignorant.
> Maybe you find yourself sitting next to some erudite f—ker at a dinner
> party who’s banging on about the Israel-Palestine situation or maybe
> you start going out with an opinionated news junkie who wants to
> discuss politics for 60,000 hours. Either way, your comparative
> ignorance leaves you ashamed. So you do something about it: you pick
> up a paper or you switch on the news. But because you’ve fallen behind
> it’s like tuning into episode 803 of the world’s most complex soap
> opera.
>
> And at the same time the news itself is becoming less of an easily
> digestible summary of events and more of a grotesque entertainment
> reality show with heavy emphasis on emotion and sensation and a
> swaggering comically theatrical sense of its own importance.
>
> In the end you just give up and, yes, you wing it: you form knee-jerk
> opinions about the sort of thing that’s in the news. Politicians and
> newsmakers notice, which is why everything’s geared more and more to
> sound bites and razzle-dazzle. The soap opera analogy is a sound one
> because that’s what the news has become.
>
> It’s showbiz, basically, and as a consequence the news has become just
> another rolling TV show who’s meaning is lost somewhere amongst all
> the babble. Sometimes it’s happy and sometimes it’s sad, but somehow,
> it isn’t real.
