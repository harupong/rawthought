<h1>A Clarification</h1>

<p>A lot of people seem to have misunderstood my piece <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology">A Non-Programmer&rsquo;s Apology</a> and my blog more generally. Let me explain:</p>

<p>I am 19 and live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in an apartment with two others. The three of us together work full-time on the site <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit.com</a> and I spend most of my days working on programming and various related tasks for it.</p>

<p>In the nights and weekends I read and think and write. I&rsquo;m working on a large book project, which I expect to take years, and which I don&rsquo;t discuss much on the Web.</p>

<p>I also think about lots of things, many of which don&rsquo;t relate to either reddit or the book project. When a thought crystalizes I type it up and post it to my blog. I don&rsquo;t read it before I post it, I don&rsquo;t show it to anyone, and I don&rsquo;t edit it. I literally sit down and type one word after another and hit save and hit upload. (Obviously, there are some exceptions, but this is standard practice.)</p>

<p>If you think the writing here is poor, that&rsquo;s probably why. Real writing takes editing. But I don&rsquo;t consider this writing, I consider this thinking. I like sharing my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, it&rsquo;s for me. I&rsquo;m sorry. Maybe that isn&rsquo;t how it should be, but at least for now that&rsquo;s how it is. In my defense, nobody&rsquo;s making you come here.</p>

<p>I plan to keep doing this until the company fails or becomes a huge success.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I hope to work on the book project (and a related project) full time.</p>

<p>I hope that clears things up.</p>
