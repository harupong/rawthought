A Clarification

A lot of people seem to have misunderstood my piece [A Non-Programmer’s
Apology](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology) and my blog more
generally. Let me explain:

I am 19 and live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in an apartment with two
others. The three of us together work full-time on the site
[reddit.com](http://reddit.com/) and I spend most of my days working on
programming and various related tasks for it.

In the nights and weekends I read and think and write. I’m working on a
large book project, which I expect to take years, and which I don’t
discuss much on the Web.

I also think about lots of things, many of which don’t relate to either
reddit or the book project. When a thought crystalizes I type it up and
post it to my blog. I don’t read it before I post it, I don’t show it to
anyone, and I don’t edit it. I literally sit down and type one word
after another and hit save and hit upload. (Obviously, there are some
exceptions, but this is standard practice.)

If you think the writing here is poor, that’s probably why. Real writing
takes editing. But I don’t consider this writing, I consider this
thinking. I like sharing my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like
practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you,
it’s for me. I’m sorry. Maybe that isn’t how it should be, but at least
for now that’s how it is. In my defense, nobody’s making you come here.

I plan to keep doing this until the company fails or becomes a huge
success.

Afterwards, I hope to work on the book project (and a related project)
full time.

I hope that clears things up.
