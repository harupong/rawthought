<h1>OCLC on the Run</h1>

<p>OCLC is running scared. <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/oclcscam">My comments</a> on their attempt to monopolize library records has been Slashdotted, <a href="http://watchdog.net/c/stop-oclc">our petition</a> has received hundreds of signatures, and they&rsquo;re starting to feel the heat.</p>

<p>At a talk I gave this morning to area librarians, an OCLC rep stood up and attempted to assure the crowd that what I was saying &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t entirely true&rdquo;. &ldquo;What wasn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to correct things.&rdquo; She declined to say, insisting she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want to get into an argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This evening, OCLC&rsquo;s Vice President for WorldCat and Metadata, provides more details. In a blog comment (which, I understand, was sent to OCLC members), she tries to downplay the issue, continuing the OCLC trend of doublespeak about this serious change.</p>

<p>She tries to claim we&rsquo;re on the same side (&ldquo;We are likely in solid agreement&rdquo;) and insists they are just updating &ldquo;the principles &hellip; which have been in place since 1987&rdquo; and absurdly claiming that the new rules are just a &ldquo;clarification&rdquo;.  (This is just one of a number of black-is-white falsehoods in her post.)</p>

<p>But never once does she defend the actual changes. And they&rsquo;re right there in black-and-white: the records aren&rsquo;t allowed to be used in anything that &ldquo;substantially replicates the function, purpose, and/or size of WorldCat.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure how much clearer they can get; these new rules prohibit anyone from building anything that gets anywhere close to WorldCat.</p>

<p>My fundamental point stands: As servers have gotten cheaper, it&rsquo;s become easy to do for free the things OCLC charges such outrageous amounts for. But OCLC can&rsquo;t have that &mdash; they&rsquo;d have to give up their huge office complex and high salaries (Ms. Calhoun was recently hired away from academia, so her salary isn&rsquo;t available yet, but her fellow VPs make around $300,000/year). So they&rsquo;re trying to stamp out the competition.</p>

<p>Karen insists that &ldquo;OCLC welcomes collaboration with Open Library&rdquo;, which seems a funny way of putting it. As I said last time, they&rsquo;ve played hardball: trying to cut off our funding, hurt our reputation, and pressured libraries not to cooperate. When we tried to make a deal with them, they dragged their feet for months, pretended to come to terms, and then had their lawyers send us an &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; to sign that would require we take all OCLC-related records off our site.</p>

<p>Karen, if you really want to &ldquo;increas[e] information access to users around the globe&rdquo;, like you say, here&rsquo;s an easy first step: put the 2 million WorldCat web pages you shared with Google and Yahoo up for download on your website. It&rsquo;s only a small portion of your catalog and you&rsquo;ve already shared it with others. Until you take even a baby step like that, it&rsquo;s hard to take your protestations of good intent seriously.</p>
