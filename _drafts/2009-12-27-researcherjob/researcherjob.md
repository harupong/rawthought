I’m looking for a researcher to work with on a couple projects. The
research will mostly be into questions of United States government
policy and the relevant factual basis. For example, you might be asked
to look up things about cap-and-trade legislation and the evidence for
anthropogenic global warming. You can do it part-time. You can work from
anywhere. I think the work will be interesting and I’ll be doing it too.
I think the work will be important, which is why I’m doing it.

The requirements are:

-   generally lefty politics

-   the ability to figure out the answers to complicated and politically
    controversial questions and find primary sources supporting those
    answers

-   the ability to write clear summaries of those answers

The ideal person is probably someone who’s contributed to Wikipedia, but
that’s not a requirement.

If you’re interested, send a paragraph you wrote explaining or
summarizing something to [me@aaronsw.com with “researcher” in the
subject](mailto:me@aaronsw.com?subject=researcher). If you have ideas
for how to find people like this, post them in the comments. (Or email
them. Whatever.) I’ll probably end up hiring a bunch of researchers so
the more people and ideas the better.
