These are sad days for American democracy. Ohio congressman [Bob
Ney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ney#Controversies) took bribes of
tens of thousands of dollars in contributions and gifts. California
congressman [Duke
Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Cunningham#Plea_agreement)
is in jail after forfeiting \$1.8 million in bribes. And Louisiana
congressman [William
Jefferson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Jefferson) is giving up \$1
million in bribes after [an FBI raid on his house found \$90,000 in a
freezer](http://harpers.org/sb-williamjefferson-21-9384239.html).

In these days of widespread corruption and bribery, it is important to
remember that no, this is not how our great democracy is supposed to
work. The bribery is supposed to be [much more
subtle](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001458) â€” not to mention legal.
