My new Python web application library, [web.py](http://webpy.org/), is
out.

[An essay of mine about
productivity](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity) has made the
rounds. I’m not sure it’s finished, but lots of people have already read
it and loved it, so I thought I might as well tell you about it.

On a similar note, over the winter break I wrote a program called
[arcget](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/arcget/) to download web sites from
the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. There are still a few more
changes I’d like to make, but I’m unlikely to get to them anytime soon.

The reason I built arcget was so I could put up the [Lingua Franca
archive](http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/). Lingua Franca was a
fantastic magazine about academic life that ran for several years before
going bust in the recession. Their website, with many of their fantastic
articles, sadly disappeared with it (and thus from Google).

Now you can read such classics as [Oh My
Darwin!](http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9911/darwin.html), [A
Most Dangerous
Method](http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9402/method.html), and
[Who Owns The
Sixties?](http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9605/sixties.html).

Of course, these and many others are collected into the wonderful
collection *[Quick
Studies](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0374528632/coolbooks02)* which,
along, with [Boob
Jubilee](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0393324303/coolbooks02) is some of
the most enjoyable and edifying material out there — combining both
dazzlingly intriguing writing with meaty subjects.

Anyway, that should keep you busy for a while.
