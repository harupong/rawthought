<p>My new Python web application library, <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, is out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity">An essay of mine about productivity</a> has made the rounds. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s finished, but lots of people have already read it and loved it, so I thought I might as well tell you about it.</p>

<p>On a similar note, over the winter break I wrote a program called <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/arcget/">arcget</a> to download web sites from the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine. There are still a few more changes I&rsquo;d like to make, but I&rsquo;m unlikely to get to them anytime soon.</p>

<p>The reason I built arcget was so I could put up the <a href="http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/">Lingua Franca archive</a>. <cite>Lingua Franca</cite> was a fantastic magazine about academic life that ran for several years before going bust in the recession. Their website, with many of their fantastic articles, sadly disappeared with it (and thus from Google).</p>

<p>Now you can read such classics as <a href="http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9911/darwin.html">Oh My Darwin!</a>, <a href="http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9402/method.html">A Most Dangerous Method</a>, and <a href="http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9605/sixties.html">Who Owns The Sixties?</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, these and many others are collected into the wonderful collection <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0374528632/coolbooks02">Quick Studies</a></em> which, along, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0393324303/coolbooks02">Boob Jubilee</a> is some of the most enjoyable and edifying material out there &mdash; combining both dazzlingly intriguing writing with meaty subjects.</p>

<p>Anyway, that should keep you busy for a while.</p>
