There are some loons on the Internet trying to spread the idea that the
fundamental law of sociology is the black-white test score gap. Put
aside the fact that anyone who would even think of proposing such an
absurd thing must be a raving scientific racist.

And put aside the fact that they must also be fairly stupid, because
such a claim is, at best, a discovery about a particular society, and
not a law. (Can you imagine someone claiming that “falling objects
accelerate at 32 feet per second per second” is a fundamental law of
physics?)

Even put aside the fact that no actual sociologist would even go near
such a claim, as the field’s entire purpose is to investigate *social*
causes of such phenomena.

No, let us look at an actual fundamental law of sociology, the Thomas
theorem. The Thomas theorem says “If men define situations as real, they
are real in their consequences.”

Now think about what that means about claiming the black-white test
score gap is an immutable law.
