* * * * *

I read over a hundred and twenty books in 2006. Some of them were OK.
Some were good. Some were very good. Here are the handful that I can
recommend you read without any reservations. This isn’t a top ten list;
the books aren’t in any particularly meaningful order. These are just
the books that I can honestly say that, as a human being, I think you
will enjoy reading (and you’ll be a better person for having done so).

Annette Lareau, *[Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0520239504)* 
:   This loving ethnography is like a trip inside the lives of children.
    Laureau spends time with families black and white; poor,
    middle-class, and wealthy. The description is engrossing and the
    theoretical contributions thought-provoking, even if you have no
    background in the field.
G. H. Hardy *[A Mathematician’s Apology](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521427061)* ([PDF](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician%27s%20Apology.pdf))
:   Godfrey Hardy was a great mathematician. But, looking back on his
    life, he wondered what it was he had actually contributed to
    society. In this, his classic defense of his pragmatically-worthless
    profession, he examines what it means to have spent your life
    wisely. (Previous thoughts: [my
    apology](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology),
    [Legacy](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/legacy).)
Raymond Smullyan, *[5000 BC (And Other Philosophical Fantasies)](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312295162)* 
:   In this bizarrely delightful little book, Smullyan, the famed
    recreational logician, addresses topics from the annoyances on long
    car rides to the most difficult problems in philosophy, often at
    once, using stories that are so delightfully amusing that it seems
    hard to believe they could have any educational value.
Atul Gawande, *[Complications: A Surgeon’s Notes on an Imperfect Science](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312421702)* 
:   Since I read this book, Gawande has become something of a rock star,
    but here he is the mild-mannered surgeon who’s writing on *Slate*
    got him picked up by the *New Yorker*. The columns in this book are
    collected from his pieces for that magazine and address with
    reflection and investigation the various difficulties of modern
    medicine.
George Saunders, *[In Persuasion Nation: Stories](http://books.theinfo.org/go/159448242X)* 
:   I have to be honest with you. I’m not really one for science
    fiction. Indeed, I’m not a big fan of fiction in general. But George
    Saunders is different: I’ll read just about anything by him.
    Saunders’ stories manage to combine a whimsically-imagined future,
    biting critique of our present era, along with a use of language so
    delightfully varied that one wonders how one man can have such
    control over his authorial voice.
Thomas Geoghegan, *[Which Side Are You On?: Trying to Be for Labor When It’s Flat on Its Back](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565848861)* 
:   One would think a book on labor history would be dreadfully dull
    and, more to the point, depressing. And yet, in the first chapter of
    this book, I found something that made me laugh or smile widely on
    practically every page. My friend Rick Perlstein got me to read this
    book by [telling
    me](http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9730) it was “the
    best political book of the last 15 years [—] the best book of the
    last 15 years.” (He’s since taken me to meet Geoghegan several
    times.) It’s hard to imagine a book more important and touching.
Robert Karen, *[Becoming Attached: Unfolding the Mystery of the Infant-Mother Bond and Its Impact on Later Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)* 
:   At the beginning of the last century, doctors thought parental love
    was unimportant: [parents weren’t allowed to even visit their kids
    in the hospital](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hospitalbabies),
    psychology experts encouraged moms not to hug or kiss their
    children, the US government handed out pamphlets on how to be firm
    with your children. This *tour de force* book tells the amazing
    story of how all that was overturned by a group of dedicated
    scientists whose research into the subject of parental love brought
    some of the most stunningly strong results in the entire field of
    psychology. Thrillingly good story, textbook on the science, and
    self-help guide all in one — I can’t recommend this book enough.
David Feige, *[Indefensible: One Lawyer’s Journey into the Inferno of American Justice](http://books.theinfo.org/go/031615623X)* 
:   Being a public defender is a fairly interesting job, but David Feige
    manages to make it downright fascinating in this in-depth
    description of his career. Feige describes his life in luscious
    detail, from the urine on his doorstep to the gritty details of the
    courtroom, and doesn’t hesitate to name names or dig into unpleasant
    subjects. If only there was a book this good on every career.
Scott McCloud, *[Making Comics: Storytelling Secrets of Comics, Manga and Graphic Novels](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0060780940)* 
:   Any Scott McCloud book is a treasure, but this one is especially
    probing. Essentially, McCloud asks what it is a writer does and what
    it takes to be a good one. His medium is comics, but a lot of the
    rules are applicable to other formats and it’s hard to imagine a
    book this curious or this well-written about them.
Dean Baker, *[The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1411693957)* ([full text](http://conservativenannystate.com/))
:   One wouldn’t expect a book about economic abuses to be fun, but Dean
    Baker manages to do it, mostly by turning everything you thought you
    knew about the subject topsy-turvy. I gave this book to a fairly
    conservative friend of mine and even he loved it. Plus it’s
    downloadable for free. ([Previous
    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/cns)) (Disclosure: I liked
    the book so much I converted it to HTML and got a free paperback
    copy in return.)
Jeremy Iversen, *[High School Confidential: Secrets of an Undercover Student](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0743283635)* ([alt. link](http://isbn.nu/0743283635))
:   Leaving school, Jeremy Iversen didn’t find the world as exciting as
    he expected. So he went back. Posing as a high school student, with
    only the school’s principal knowing the truth, he spent half a year
    among the kids and teachers, documenting the life of the average
    Californian and wondering what it meant for our nation’s future. The
    result is an amazingly good read and a fascinating look at an
    incredibly important institution. ([Previous
    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/undercoverlearning))
    (Disclosure: I’ve [hung
    out](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visitingla) with the author.)
Laura Kipnis, *[Against Love: A Polemic](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375719326)* 
:   Kipnis is a rollickingly vicious writer, with sentences that have
    the rhythm and punch of a machine gun. But the book isn’t just a fun
    rant, it also makes an incredibly thought-provoking argument about
    what it means socially to be in a relationship. ([Previous
    review.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/againstlove))
Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames, *[The eXile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0802136524)* 
:   Matt Taibbi is my favorite political journalist. He writes with a
    raw honesty that manages to be both politically biting and
    hilarious. This book tells the story of how, after playing
    professional basketball in Inner Mongolia, met up with co-founder
    Mark Ames and started an independent newspaper that danced in the
    flames of Russia’s dying society. The result is a strange and
    incredible book: stories of seedy dive bars full of drugged up loose
    women, intermixed with incredible feats of investigative journalism
    into the oligarchs dragging Russia down — without any change in
    tone. It’s wonderful.
Joan Didion, *[Political Fictions](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0375718907)* 
:   Damn, this book is good. Nobody knows how to take a book and skewer
    it like Didion. The *New York Review of Books* pieces reprinted in
    here are simply some of the best eviscerations of any genre. Its
    hard to imagine how people can walk after a review like that.
Jonathan Franzen, *[The Corrections: A Novel](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0312421273)* 
:   After the popular reviews and the Oprah’s Book Club selection, I had
    just about learned to ignore Franzen’s big novel. But when a friend
    told me she was loving it, I decided to check it out. That was no
    mistake. This is a thoughtful, readable piece of fiction, with big
    geeky topics and a hearty emotional core.
Rick Perlstein, *Nixonland* 
:   Perlstein’s last book, *Before the Storm*, managed to turn the story
    the a largely-dismissed political figure, Barry Goldwater, into a
    lesson on how the left can take over the country. Now, in
    *Nixonland*, he examines the turmoil of the 1960s with fresh eyes
    and the perfidy of the Nixon administration with new depth. I read
    the book as he was writing it and sent comments — apparently I was
    the first outside his home to finish it — and the final version
    hasn’t been published. But do be sure to pick it up as soon as it
    is.
