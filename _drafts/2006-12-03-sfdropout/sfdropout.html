<p>I was wondering what I was going to find for today&rsquo;s Sunday Bonus Post. Luckily, at the last minute, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> stepped in to save me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aaron Swartz dropped out of high school after one year to study on his own. Then he dropped out of college after one year to seek his high-tech fortune. He was still in his teens a year later when he hit the jackpot, selling his startup in October to Wired Digital for an undisclosed but lottery-like payout.</p>
  
  <p>With his boyish mien and more geek credentials than engineers twice his age, the suddenly wealthy Swartz belongs to a new generation of young, brainy geeks who began booting up and logging on when their friends were still watching &ldquo;Sesame Street.&rdquo; Before they were old enough to drive, they landed paying gigs. Now that another high-tech boom is heating up Silicon Valley, more of these technologically developed but underage techies are dropping out and starting up.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;]</p>
  
  <p>&ldquo;Everything that would get you detention at school will get you funding in Silicon Valley,&rdquo; said Paul Saffo, a valley forecaster and essayist who has been exploring technological change and its impact on business and society for more than two decades.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;]</p>
  
  <p>Fancy new car? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to drive,&rdquo; Swartz wrote on his blog, Raw Thought. Big house in the suburbs? &ldquo;I like living in small apartments.&rdquo; Expensive clothes? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worn a T-shirt and jeans practically every day of my life.&rdquo; Hanging with the cool kids? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so shy I don&rsquo;t even hang out with the people I know now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excuse my self-indulgence.</p>
