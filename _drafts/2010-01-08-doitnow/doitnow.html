<h1>Do It Now</h1>

<p>A year or two ago, I came up with a brilliant scheme for handling my email. The problem, I decided, was that there was just too much of it. Spam was mixed in with notes from friends along with important things from work and todo items I&rsquo;d written to myself. What I needed to do was go thru and sort it &mdash; pick out the really important stuff to handle right away and move the junk to the bottom. So I wrote a little program that would let me go through and sort my email into neat little folders ordered by priority.</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what happened: I sorted all my email, and then I didn&rsquo;t answer any of it. I told myself that I shouldn&rsquo;t answer the unimportant stuff until the important stuff was taken care of, then when I looked at the important stuff it seemed hard, so I decided to go read some blogs first. To this day, all those important emails are just sitting there.</p>

<p>Recently, I came up with a really dumb system for handling my email: just do it. I&rsquo;d start at the top of my inbox, answer the most recent email, and move on to the next one. No excuses. No matter what the email at the top was &mdash; no matter how difficult or awkward or unimportant, I had to answer it. I couldn&rsquo;t move on to another email and come back to it later. I had to answer the most recent email, no matter what it was.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, I&rsquo;d answered a month&rsquo;s worth of email.</p>

<p>We procrastinate because we are afraid. We&rsquo;re afraid it&rsquo;s too much work and that it will drain us. We&rsquo;re afraid we&rsquo;ll screw it up and get in trouble. We&rsquo;re afraid we don&rsquo;t know how to do it. We&rsquo;re afraid because, well, we&rsquo;ve been putting it off forever and every time we put it off it seems a little more fearsome in our minds. That&rsquo;s why not putting things off is so liberating. We&rsquo;re forced to confront our fears, not let them grow bigger by repeatedly running away. And when we confront them, we find they&rsquo;re not so scary after all.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t just apply to email, of course &mdash; it works for any todo list. But only if you say no to reordering, prioritizing, estimating deadlines, and doing the most important things first. Forget all that. Do it now.</p>
