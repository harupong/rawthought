I got my FBI file today. ([Request
yours!](http://foia.fbi.gov/privacy_instruc.htm)) As I hoped, it’s truly
delightful. It has only minor redactions for reasons of personal privacy
(basically, they deleted agents’ names and so on). It all started when
the—actually, I’ll let the file tell the story:

February 6, from Washington Field to Chicago:
