<p>I got my FBI file today. (<a href="http://foia.fbi.gov/privacy_instruc.htm">Request yours!</a>) As I hoped, it&rsquo;s truly delightful. It has only minor redactions for reasons of personal privacy (basically, they deleted agents&rsquo; names and so on). It all started when the&mdash;actually, I&rsquo;ll let the file tell the story:</p>

  <p><strong>Title:</strong> UNSUB(s);
  US COURTS - VICTIM;
  COMPUTER INTRUSION - OTHER</p>
  
  <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> To set lead to locate Aaron Swartz.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enclosure(s):</strong> Attached is an Accurint Report for Swartz.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Details:</strong> The U.S. Courts implemented a pilot project offering free access to federal court records through the PACER system at seventeen federal depository libraries. Library personnel maintain login and password security and provide access to users from computers within the library. PACER normally carries an eight cents per page fee, however, by accessing from one of the seventeen libraries, users may search and download data for free.</p>
  
  <p>Between September 4, 2008 and September 22, 2008, PACER was accessed by computers from outside the library utilizing login information from two libraries participating in the pilot project. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reported that the PACER system was being inundated with requests. One request was being made every three seconds.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;] The two accounts were responsible for downloading more than eighteen million pages with an approximate value of $1.5 million.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;] Data that was exfiltrated went to one of two Amazon IP addresses.</p>
  
  <p>Investigation has determined that the Amazon IP address used to access the PACER system belongs to Aaron Swartz.</p>
  
  <p>The following information was provided for the IP address:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Name: Aaron Swartz<br>
    Address: 349 Marshman Avenue, Highland Park, IL 60035<br>
    Telephone: 847-432-8857</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>A search in Accurint and Swartz&rsquo;s personal webpage confirmed this information. Swartz&rsquo;s social security account number is [&hellip;]. The telephone subscriber for telephone number [REDACTED] is [REDACTED].</p>
  
  <p>NCIS report for Aaron Swartz was negative. A search for wages for Swartz at the Department of Labor was negative.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;]</p>
  
  <p>Washington Field Office requests that the North RA attempt to locate AARON SWARTZ, his vehicles, drivers license information and picture, and others, at 349 Marshman Avenue, Highland Park, IL 60035. Since SWARTZ is the potential subject of an ongoing investigation, it is requested that SWARTZ not be approached by agents.</p>

House is set on a deep lot, behind other houses on Marshman Avenue. This is a heavily wooded, dead-end street, with no other cars parked on the road making continued surveillance difficult to conduct without severely increasing the risk of discovery. However, divers license and Accurint information lists address above. Other family members are listed as current residents and four vehicles are currently registered to Susan Swartz who resides at above address. Illinois database checks for SWARTZ yielded negative results. SWARTZ has no arrests, no registered vehicles or property.</p>
