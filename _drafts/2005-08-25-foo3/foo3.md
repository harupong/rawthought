I was recently excited to be invited to FOO camp, where all the leading
figures of the modern technology industry shared their deep thoughts
with me. Having already started a successful startup, I decided this
year it was time to give back to the community, so I did some one-on-one
consulting with future entrepreneurs.

Here’s a photo of me listening to a pitch from up-and-comer Ada Norton
about the layer architecture of her new Fish-on-Puppies web application
framework. Definitely one to watch — I’ve recommended that Y Combinator
invest immediately.

I generously gave [Ada](http://www.livejournal.com/users/dailyada/) a
20% discount off my normal consulting fees, in exchange for 10% of the
company. I hope that other entrepreneurs will follow my lead in
generously giving back to the community.
