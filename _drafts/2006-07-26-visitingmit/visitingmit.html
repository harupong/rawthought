<h1>I Love the University</h1>

<p>I went to visit a friend today at MIT. The past few days I&rsquo;d been
reading more stuff from academia and just that morning I was reading
responses to my old posts at Stanford, so academia&rsquo;s siren song had been
on my mind. But getting off the subway at MIT, with me full of energy
after a morning jog, the sun shining brightly down, I couldn&rsquo;t help but
feel like I was missing something, seeing smiles on the faces of the
young geniuses who were everywhere around me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s natural, when doing something so greedy and practical as a
startup, to pine for the idealized world of academia. Its image as a
place in an idyllic location filled with smart people has always been
attractive; even more so with the sense that by being there one can get
smarter simply through osmosis. People describe a place of continual
geekiness, of throwing chemicals into the river and building robots in
free time. A magical place for hackers to just enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t enjoy my work; it&rsquo;s just that I feel like I&rsquo;m
getting dumber doing it. Or, at least, that I&rsquo;m not getting as smart as
I should.</p>

<p>This academaphilia isn&rsquo;t new. It&rsquo;s clearly what drove magazines like
Lingua Franca and makes saying obscure names and words so impressive.
But for some reason it feels stronger now. I&rsquo;ve started downloading
class syllabuses off the Web and doing the reading assignments at night;
I&rsquo;ve started thinking about how to sneak into courses and hang out with
academics. In Cambridge, this paradise seems so close, so acessible.</p>

<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s hardly paradise at all. When I was actually there I was
turned off by the conformism, the lack of interest in real work, the
politics, the pointless assignments. My lunch date is a grad student and
he tells me of the internecine squabbles, the overspecialization, the
abandonment, the insecurity.</p>

<p>I go back to the W3C&rsquo;s offices and stand at the balcony. Down below, Tim
Berners-Lee discusses details of a project with a group of kids who
presumably took this on as summer job. I was once one of those kids,
working there, and I think about why I left and why I miss it. I marvel
at the pointlessness, the impracticality, the waste.</p>

<p>The sky is overcast now, the crowds of students have thinned out, and
those that remain scurry from place to place with their heads down. I&rsquo;m
tired now, I feel sadder, and I wonder how I lost so much so quickly.</p>

<p>I want to feel nostalgic, I want to feel like there&rsquo;s this place, just a
couple subway stops away, where everything will be alright. A better
place, a place I should be in, a place I can go back to. But even just
visiting it, the facts are plain. It doesn&rsquo;t exist, it never has. I&rsquo;m
nostalgic for a place that never existed.</p>
