* * * * *

It’s minutes to midnight and I’m hurriedly packing. Early tomorrow
morning I catch a flight to Boston and start [my new
life](http://aaronsw.com/weblog/movingon). I haven’t really gotten much
of a chance to pack until now, because I’ve spent the past few days in a
rush of meetings, getting in my last goodbyes for everyone I know in San
Francisco.

It’s been great seeing everyone, but like most locals, they’re all
puzzled as to why I’m leaving. I’ve been struggling to explain why. When
I say the weather, everyone just laughs. When I say San Francisco is too
loud, they start arguing. When I say it’s the people, they tell me to
find a better group of friends.

And the thing is, they’re right. It’s none of these. I’ve been
spectacularly unable to articulate it, but the real answer is simpler
and more prosaic. And now, after great thought and struggle, I realize
the answer is simply this: *Cambridge is the only place that’s ever felt
like home.* It’s that simple. And when you put it that way, it’s clear
why I have to go.

So goodbye Stanford, goodbye Palo Alto; goodbye south bay, goodbye
peninsula; goodbye Change Congress, goodbye Creative Commons; goodbye
Mission, goodbye SOMA; goodbye friends, goodbye loved ones; goodbye San
Francisco, home to everyone I’ve ever loved. You’ll always have my
heart.
