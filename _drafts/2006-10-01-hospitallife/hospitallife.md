> The very walls of the hospital seemed to suck the life out of
> me—painted in puke yellow—and the window, which did look out at some
> trees, unfortunately framed a week’s worth of grey, rainy weather. The
> floors and walls were filthy (I won’t even mention the bathroom); the
> furniture old, chipped and stained; the framed artwork (like an old
> puzzle drawing out of Boy’s Life magazine with faces and animals and
> broomsticks hiding in the trees) faded; the food rancid, stinky and
> inedibly heavy and overly sweet. I seldom saw the doctors wash their
> hands or use the Purell dispenser on the wall (I began to fear
> catching some super hospital germ infection). When I could finally
> walk the halls in my hideous hospital gowns and infantilizing slipper
> socks, I was tethered to a top-heavy pole with bad wheels, which made
> dragging it over any bumps or turning corners an exercise in futility.
> I begged to be let out, to be sent home where it was clean, where I
> could have simple healthy food and take a shower; I begged the
> residents, the doctors (when they came on rounds) to take the tubes
> out of me. And they just made me feel idiotic, patronized, weak and
> helpless.

> Finally, in the middle of one sleepless, endless night spent staring
> at the walls, being sure the clock was actually moving backwards, it
> occurred to me with perfect clarity that the patient is never going to
> win the battle with the doctors…because the doctors have all the
> weapons. Just then the door slammed open, yet another nurse threw on
> all the lights and jabbed me with a needle, filling me with some other
> substance she refused to identify. Oh god, it was the most horrible
> hospital experience I have ever been through. And the scariest part of
> it is that this hospital is on the list of the 100 Best Hospitals in
> Illinois. Imagine what the others not on the list are like.
