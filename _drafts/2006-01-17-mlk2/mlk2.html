<blockquote>
  <p>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&rsquo;s Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &ldquo;order&rdquo; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo;</p>
