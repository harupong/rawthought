In a famous experiment, some people are asked to choose between \$100
today or \$120 tomorrow. Many choose the first. Meanwhile, some people
are asked to choose between \$100 sixty days from now or \$120 sixty-one
days from now. Almost everyone choose the laster. The puzzle is this:
why are people willing to sacrifice \$20 to avoid waiting a day right
now but not in the future?

The standard explanation is hyperbolic discounting: humans tend to weigh
immediate effects much more strongly than distant ones. But I think the
actual psychological effect at work here is just [the percentage
fallacy](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/percentagefallacy). If I ask for
the money now, I may have to wait 60 seconds. But if I get it tomorrow I
have to wait 143900%more. By contrast, waiting 61 days is only 1.6%
worse than waiting 6 days. Why not wait an extra 2% when you get 16%
more money for it?

Has anyone done a test confirming the percentage fallacy? A good test
would be to show people treat the \$100 vs. \$120 tradeoff as equivalent
to the \$1000 to \$1200 tradeoff.
