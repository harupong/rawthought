<blockquote>
  <p>MOST PEOPLE who work at Google are in SUPPORT roles!! And they are getting paid way less than industry standard for working 50, 60+ hours a week for it! Screw the free food, screw the laundry - the MAJORITY of people working at Google are in buildings without any of these amenities, and are certainly without extra money from stock options.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;] they are the ones working their asses off, in overtime, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter because they are salaried but way below industry standards for support positions, to make sure that YOU, the user, has an accessible Help Center, has a kind, email response, has an answer to your question.</p>
  
  <p>Yes, there are foosball tables in the support buildings, but who has time to play them? Giant overhead projectors alerting them to the current turnaround time for their emails is Big Brother enough to ensure that they don&rsquo;t even THINK about playing foosball when they should be answering support emails. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are not nice alternatives - they are NECESSARY to ensure that all of the support peons remain dutiful and consistent with their email turnaround times.</p>
  
  <p>Wow, sounds like they&rsquo;re overworked. Can&rsquo;t Google just hire more people? HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! For a response to that, please see the above comments. It&rsquo;s as hard to get a support role here if you&rsquo;re an MBA with a PhD as a hobby, as if you invented nuclear physics.</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been here almost 5 years, and as soon as my refresher grant has vested, I am out like Lance Bass. It&rsquo;s a load of corporate baloney - the 400-person company that I started at has become a nightmare that has eaten my soul. God help the users.</p>
