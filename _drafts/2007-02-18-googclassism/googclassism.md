> MOST PEOPLE who work at Google are in SUPPORT roles!! And they are
> getting paid way less than industry standard for working 50, 60+ hours
> a week for it! Screw the free food, screw the laundry - the MAJORITY
> of people working at Google are in buildings without any of these
> amenities, and are certainly without extra money from stock options.

> […] they are the ones working their asses off, in overtime, but that
> doesn’t matter because they are salaried but way below industry
> standards for support positions, to make sure that YOU, the user, has
> an accessible Help Center, has a kind, email response, has an answer

> Yes, there are foosball tables in the support buildings, but who has

> Wow, sounds like they’re overworked. Can’t Google just hire more
