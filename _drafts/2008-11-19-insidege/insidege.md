For the past six months or so, I’ve been working on getting data out of
government in various ways. At one point, I was looking thru SEC files
online and noticed that some portions were redacted. I filed a Freedom
of Information request for the redacted portion and any documents
pertaining to why it was redacted. It ended up costing \$28 and to make
sure I get the most for my money, I thought I’d share the results with
you:

Hope that helps. At least the SEC uses white-out instead of black
marker.
