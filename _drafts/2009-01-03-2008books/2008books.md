*Previously:* [2007 Review of
Books](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2007), [Books I recommend
Without Reservation: 2006](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)

I read exactly 100 books this year. I mistakenly told someone over the
summer that I read a hundred books a year (I only read 70 last year,
although 120 the year before that) and as the new year approached I felt
duty-bound to make that true. (This led to spending a lot of New Year’s
Eve in a corner reading, as this list may suggest.)

Here are the books (in chronological order), with occasional short
comments. Books I’m happy to have read are linked. Books I recommend are
in bold.

1.  *[Quantum Theory: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0192802526)*. Seemed
    decent for the format.
2.  Gecan, *[Going Public](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1400076498)*
3.  *[The Activist’s Handbook](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0520229282)*.
    Could be better written, but probably the best of its type. I’ve
    definitely thought back to this one a lot this year.
4.  Poundstone, *[How Would You Move Mount
    Fuji?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316778494)*
5.  Poundstone, *[Labyrinths of
    Reason](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385242719)*
6.  Lodge, ***[Changing
    Places](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140170987)***.

    Typical campus novel fun, but with some great People’s Park stories.

7.  Elster, *[Political
    Psychology](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521422868)*. Short Elster
    essay collection. Probably for Elster fans only.

8.  *[Lords of Poverty](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0871134691)*
    (skipped parts)
9.  *On Being Nonprofit*. Completely unmemorable.
10. *How to Do Things with Words*. Important in its time, but mostly
    overtaken by Searle’s later work.
11. *The Revolution Will Not Be Televised*
12. *Campaign Finance Reform and the Future of the Democratic Party*
13. ***[The Visible Hand](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0674940520)*.**

    Tough sledding, but important points. [Read my
    summary](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visiblehand).

14. Thaler, *[The Winner’s
    Curse](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691019347)*

15. Poundstone, ***[Fortune’s
    Formula](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0809045990)***

    Fantastic fun. Math, mafiosi, movies.

16. Freeman, *[Rawls](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0415301084)* (parts)

17. MacKenzie, *[An Engine Not a
    Camera](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262633671)*.

    I recommend [starting with his *LRB*
    stuff](http://delicious.com/aaronsw/donaldmackenzie).

18. Fitch, *[Solidarity for
    Sale](http://books.theinfo.org/go/189162072X)*. For leftists who
    really love unions. You need to know the flaws to make them better.

19. Maisel, *[From Obscurity to Oblivion: Running in the Congressional
    Primary](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0870493477)*. Not a lot of
    books on the inside of campaigns, but this is one of the few.
20. Segaran, *[Programming Collective
    Intelligence](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0596529325)*. Terrible
    title, but a good book on how to do data mining.
21. Willis, *[Learning to
    Labor](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231053576)*. Not as great as the
    excerpts I’d read had led me to think.
22. *[The Brain: A Very Short
    Introduction](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0192853929)*
23. Peck, *[Hatchet Jobs](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1595580271)*. Fun
    stuff.
24. Sloan, *My Years with General Motors* (skipped second half). I read
    this to understand how modern management was invented. It did not
    help.
25. Hoopes, ***[False
    Prophets](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738207985)***

    A wonderful series of profiles of the most prominent management
    theorists going back to slavery and Taylor. The book’s editorial
    line is a bit marred by the inability of the author (a B-School prof
    and manager) to reconcile his belief that management power is unjust
    and that it is necessary. But solid history and good takedowns of
    some important figures.

26. Dani Rodrik, *[Has Globalization Gone Too
    Far?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0881322415)* (lent by Henry
    Farrell). A good book, but not for general readers.

27. *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Mixed feelings.
28. Wilson, ***[To The Finland
    Station](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1590170334)*.**

    Really, really good. Edmund Wilson was the incredible writer you’d
    expect and this is his masterpiece.

29. Maurer, ***[The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence
    Man](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0385495382)***

    [Luc Sante’s intro](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/447) alone is
    worth the price of the book, but the rest of the book is fantastic
    as well. Everyone should know about con men. (The BBC’s *Hustle* is
    obviously a television adaptation of the book.)

30. *A Choice Not an Echo: The Inside Story of How American Presidents
    Are Chosen*. Still crazy after all these years, although the whole
    anti-backroom thing is interesting. I read it to see what you could
    airdrop on college kids.

31. Khurana, ***[Searching for a Corporate
    Savior](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691120390)***

    Really, truly great.

32. *Is That a Politician in Your Pocket?* (skimmed)

33. *[Debunking Economics](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1856499928)*.
    Quite good, although not perfect.
34. *Men and Women of the Corporation*.
35. Carlson, *Executive Behavior*. Worthless
36. Elster, ***[Explaining Social
    Behavior](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521777445)***

    Magical, magisterial masterpiece. ([my
    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/toolbox); [more on
    Elster](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aaaronsw.com%20elster))

37. Piven, *Challenging Authority*. Kind of thin; I glazed over
    portions.

38. Rosen, *[The World Split
    Open](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140097198)*
39. Mary Douglas, *How Institutions Think*. Terrible.
40. *[From the Folks Who Brought You the
    Weekend](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1565847768)*
41. *Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences*
42. Brook, *[The Trap](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088016)*
43. Gessen, *[All the Sad Young Literary
    Men](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0670018554)*
44. Khurana, *From Higher Aims to Hired Hands*
45. Glymour, *[The Mind’s
    Arrows](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262072203)*
46. Pearl, *[Causality](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0521773628)*. I wish
    everyone understood this.
47. Elster, *[Strong Feelings](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0262550369)*
48. Gelman et. al., *[Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor
    State](http://redbluerichpoor.com/)* (sent by Andrew Gelman). Lots
    of great empirical work, but little theory or story to back it up.
49. Lodge, ***[Nice Work](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0140133968)***

    Typical campus novel fun, but with deeper thoughts about business
    and finance.

50. Armstrong and Moulitsas, *[Crashing the
    Gate](http://books.theinfo.org/go/193339241X)*

51. Menand, *[American Studies](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0374529000)*
52. Galbraith, ***[The Predator
    State](http://books.theinfo.org/go/141656683X)***

    [My summary](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/predatorstate).

53. ***[Watchmen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401219268)***

    Brilliant. Wanted to see it before the movie came out.

54. Tilly, *Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons*

55. Mann, *[Sources of Social Power, Vol.
    1](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000PS4V0W)*

    Tough reading, but really fascinating stuff.

56. Frank, *[The Wrecking
    Crew](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805079882)*. Lots of good dirt,
    but not exactly the most rigorous theoretical argument.

57. Perry, *[Spectrum](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844671356)*. Perry
    is great — the autoinvestigatorial last chapter alone is worth it.
58. Bearman et. al.,
    *[Doormen](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0226039692)*. I read this
    because I now have a doorman and am uncomfortable about it. This
    helped.
59. Teles, *[Rise of the Conservative Legal
    Movement](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691122083)*. Good stuff,
    although narrow.
60. DFW, *[McCain’s Promise](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316040533)*.
    Brilliant, naturally. I’d read *Up, Simba!* before, of course, but I
    read this out loud to a friend and it was just a joy to do.
61. Ken Silverstein,
    *[Turkmeniscam](http://books.theinfo.org/go/140006743X)*.

    Great fun. Not just a great story of investigative journalism, but
    lots of interesting and important background as well. I’m a huge
    Silverstein fan.

62. **DFW**, *[Everything and
    More](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393326292)*.

    This book is an interesting, but, I think, ultimately unsuccessful
    experiment. DFW tries to teach math by channelling his favorite math
    teacher — writing in the style of an excitable lecturer, completely
    with verbal tics and backtracking (which, in printed form, becomes
    kind of a running gag).

    It’s certainly not a bad book by any means, but I don’t think it’s
    really a successful model for how books can teach math.

63. Wodehouse, *[Psmith in the
    City](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1585674788)*. Hilarious. Psmith is
    a delight. I want to hear him acted but the recent BBC version is
    dreadful.

64. Clark, *[Organizing Our Marvellous Neighbours](http://en-ca.org/)*
    (skimmed parts)
65. *[How Wikipedia Works](http://howwikipediaworks.com/)* (skimmed
    parts)
66. Latour and Woolgar, *[Laboratory
    Life](http://books.theinfo.org/go/069102832X)*. Delightful. I
    apologize humbly and abjectly for ever criticizing the strong
    programme of science. Sokal and Bricmont led me badly astray on that
    one.
67. DFW, *[Consider the
    Lobster](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316013323)*

    DFW’s suicide hit me very hard. I ended up coping [by reading every
    piece of nonfiction he’d ever
    published](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw/David_Foster_Wallace_nonfiction).
    He was a brilliant, tortured man and I see so much of myself in him.
    His nonfiction was fantastic and I will consider my life a success
    if I can do half of what he did.

    If you want to get started, I recommend (best work first):

    1.  [Federer as Religious
        Experience](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=print)
        [[B/W
        PDF](http://www.theknowe.net/dfwfiles/pdfs/Wallace-Federer_as_Religious_Experience.pdf)]
    2.  “David Lynch Keeps His Head”, in *A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll
        Never Do Again* (there’s a *severely* abbreviated version
        printed in *Premiere*; read the real thing instead)
    3.  “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again”, in *A Supposedly
        Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again* (the [*Harper’s*
        version](http://harpers.org/archive/1996/01/0007859)
        [[PDF](http://www.harpers.org/media/pdf/dfw/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf)]
        preserves most of the good stuff but is shorter)

68. Krugman, ***[Peddling
    Prosperity](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0393312925)***

    Probably Krugman’s best book, it provides a throughly enjoyable and
    enlightening *intellectual* overview of the economics of the 1980s
    and 1990s. The delicious takedown of supplysiders is worth the book
    alone, but the rest is great too.

69. Tough, *[Whatever It
    Takes](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0618569898)*. A great read; a bit
    overly credulous — doesn’t address Keynesian critics of intervention
    or betray much skepticism about tests. ([my
    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whateverittakes))

70. Wolfe, *[Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak
    Catchers](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0553380621)*. Great fun.
71. *[The Homework Myth](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0738211117)*.
    Sometimes it seems like Kohn just gets narrower and narrower (via
    email, he disputes this).
72. *[Savage Mules](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1844672654)*. A good
    antidote for faith in the Democratic Party. ([dsquared’s
    review](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/07/22/book-review-savage-mules))
73. Beam, *[Great Idea at the
    Time](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1586484877)*. A fun historical
    take down of the Great Books. Probably more fun if you know what the
    Great Books are.
74. *A Brief History of Neoliberalism*. Borderline unreadable. Why did
    everyone rave about this book?
75. ***[Love at Goon Park](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0425194051)***.

    The first section is a (confessed!) retread of *[Becoming
    Attached](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0195115015)*, one of my very
    favorite books ([a 2006
    highlight](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2006)). But after that
    it gets much better and the interplay of animal and human stories is
    a lot of fun. I’ve been reading it to the five-year-old, who loves
    animal stories of all sorts, and she just laps it up. (I skip the
    incredibly dark parts, of course.)

76. Newsweek, *[Secrets of the 2008
    Campaign](http://www.newsweek.com/id/167581)* (full text online).
    For campaign junkies only.

77. Perlstein, *[Tested](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805088024)*.

    Very good. ([my
    review](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/kindergartenkafka))

78. Keynes, *[Economic Consequences of the
    Peace](http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15776) (full text online)*.

    Wow, Keynes knows how to write. The first section is a must-read for
    any diplomat. Chapters 4 and 5 (which unfortunately are the bulk of
    the book) are only worth skipping or skimming for modern readers.

79. Kaufman, *Synecdoche, New York* (scripts). What a movie! There were
    a lot of script reviews that said things along the lines of “I don’t
    know if movies can capture a script this complex.” Reading the
    script now, you see the exact opposite is the case. The script is a
    pale imitation of the film, missing most of what made the film
    magical. Which just underscores what a great movie it was.

80. Bowles and Gintis, *[Schooling in Capitalist
    America](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0465097189)*.

    Not the easiest read, but brilliant. One of the very very few books
    I want to read again (in this case, because I am sure I didn’t get
    it all the first time). The definitive Marxist take on education.

81. *[Smile When You’re Lying](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0805082093)*

    Tons of fun. I hate traveling and have never cracked a travel book,
    but this angry and profane insider’s evisceration of the industry
    was still a complete joy. [Read Ezra’s
    review](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska)
    — with [a comment from the
    author](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&year=2008&base_name=baked_alaska#comment-6236833)!.

82. DFW, *[A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do
    Again](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0316925284)*.

    Brilliant. Just brilliant.

83. Keynes, *Essays in Persuasion*.

84. Douthat, *Privilege* (lent by Rick Perlstein).

    What is wrong with Ross Douthat? This book is eminently mockable,
    but I have to say I could see writing most of it myself. Which is
    weird, since Douthat is a staunch conservative and I’m a
    crazy-far-leftist. Is Douthat a double-agent? Or is he really this
    confused about what conservatism is about? I wrote this summary for
    Rick:

    -   Prologue: Harvard is actually an education in the ruling class.
        [Ross didn’t like Harvard so much.]

    -   1: Diversity policies ensure all sorts of ethnicities get
        accepted but they all come from the upper class. [Big black
        homeless guy starts living in Ross’s dorm.]

    -   2: The real ruling class gets tapped for private clubs where
        they get connected to wealthy alumni and rape attractive coeds.
        [Ross gets invited to apply at various clubs and rejected.]

    -   3: Students are aggressive social climbers, calibrating who they
        talk to and what activities they join to maximize their resume.
        [Ross’s friend’s friend gets arrested for embezzling.]

    -   4: Persuaded that the market is God and academia is a sideshow,
        professors give students easy grades to help them get good jobs
        and be rich (thus proving the professors’ worth). Courses are
        poorly taught and maddeningly specific — its very difficult to
        get a solid general education. [Ross doesn’t like his classes
        and gets mediocre grades.]

    -   5: Random drunken hookups are so common that the only way to get
        any kind of commitment is to fall into a college marriage (of
        which, I must say, there is a beautiful description pp.
        145-147). [Ross falls head-over-heels for a totally agonizing
        tease, only to have her give it up months later to a preppy
        sailing kid who gets her drunk.]

    -   6: Most harvard students arrive virgins and have a hards time
        getting any while they’re there, out of awkwardness and fear of
        threatening their spot in the overclass. [Ross can’t even get
        laid at an all-girls school.]

    -   7: The student body is primarily New Democrat, with a smattering
        of vocal leftist protestors. [Ross supports the living wage
        movement. [*ed. note:* wtf?]]

    -   8: Harvard students spend summers at elite internships
        acclimating to their future careers. [Ross goes sailing with
        William F. Buckley!]

    -   9: 9/11 sucked. [Ross laps up the patriotic spirit and the
        Summers presidency.]

    -   …and then a tearfelt ending.

    Sorry, did I end up mocking it a little?

85. Gore, *[Sammy’s Hill](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401360297)*. Yes,
    I have a weakness for chick lit.

86. *[What Motivates
    Bureaucrats?](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0231106971)* A genuine
    investigation (as opposed to the typical social science arms-length
    thinking) into how Reagan affected the civil service. In short, our
    civil service is the opposite of what you see on *Yes, Minister* —
    they were practically falling over themselves to kneecap their own
    agency in response to the President. Kind of sad, but hopefully this
    means that Obama will also have wide lattitude.
87. DFW and Mark Costello, *[Signifying
    Rappers](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0880015357)*.

    A great book, although surprisingly the best parts are written by
    Costello. A dense intermixed weave of music, history, race, law,
    fantasia, and brilliant writing.

88. *[The Telephone Gambit](http://books.theinfo.org/go/039333368X)*.
    Decently researched, mixed in with self-indulgent (and just plain
    bad) autobiography about writing the book. I wrote up a summary of
    the story which I’ll be publishing soon and you should probably just
    read that instead. But everybody should agree that Bell stole the
    telephone from Gray after this book.

89. Krugman, *The Age of Diminished Expectations* (1st ed). Bleh.
    Krugman’s first book, back before he knew how to write.
90. Bartels, *[Unequal
    Democracy](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0691136637)*. I’m also going
    to publish a summary of this.
91. Beam, *Gracefully Insane*. Like all good residents of Cambridge,
    being institutionalized in McLean has long been a dream. After
    enjoying Beam’s other book (*Great Idea at the Time*) this seemed
    right up my alley, but it was nowhere near as good.
92. Gore, *[Sammy’s House](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1401309496)*. The
    Gore books were bothering me because I could never figure out who
    Wye and RG were supposed to be — all the other characters mapped
    pretty obviously onto current politicians, but the candidates were a
    mystery. I’d somehow forgotten my first instinct: RG is AG, which
    means that you have to think back two decades or so. Once you
    realize that, everything falls into place.
93. Wodehouse, *Mike: A Public School Story*. The first Psmith story.
    Cricket, cricket, cricket, cricket. Sigh.
94. *[Ice Cream Man](http://books.theinfo.org/go/B000JLTS8U)*. Good fun
    for Tosci’s fans.
95. Kuttner, *[Obama’s
    Challenge](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1603580794)*
96. *V for Vendetta*. Moore’s whole story about how the movie softened
    the fascism and anarchism seems completely bogus. That said, the
    movie did change some fantastic parts, including V’s televised
    speech and the brilliantly convoluted *Hamlet*-esque ending. Also,
    the movie’s whole virus attack subplot was stupid. On the other
    hand, the movie added some great stuff too. So see both, I guess.
97. Krugman, *Pop Internationalism*. The essays Krugman wrote before
    *Peddling Prosperity*, meaning it discusses the same stuff but much
    more disjointed and poorly edited. I was hoping it’d explain the
    mystery of his animus towards Laura D’A, but no such luck.
98. *[First-Time Manager](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0814408214)*. A
    much better book than I expected, but enough tin-ear corporate
    silliness that I can’t thoroughly recommend it.
99. Searle, **[*The Campus
    War*](http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/campus.html)** (full text
    online).

    Actually, a really good book on the campus uprisings of the 1960s.
    First, there’s some terrific first-hand reporting from Searle’s
    experience at Berkeley (in which he participated in all three sides:
    the uprising, the faculty response, and the administration
    counterattack!). Second, there’s some good secondhand summarizing
    about the experience at other campuses. Third, there’s some good
    analysis about why campus uprisings happen and what they mean.
    Fourth, there are some interesting proposals for reforming the
    university. (I, too, want to get rid of the trustee system.) Makes
    me wish Searle did more non-philosophy books!

100. Haggis-on-Whey, *Animals of the Ocean (In Particular, the Giant
    Squid)*. Not as good as [the
    original](http://books.theinfo.org/go/1932416978) (now in its third
    edition!).

Happy new year!
