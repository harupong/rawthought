> True, those who have abandoned the life of a free man do nothing but
> boast incessantly of the peace and repose they enjoy in their chains.
> But when I see the other sacrifice pleasures, repose, wealth, power
> and life itself for the preservation of this sole good, which is so
> disdained by those who have lost it, when I see multitudes of entirely
> naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire,
> the sword and death to preserve only their independence, I feel it
> does not behoove slaves to reason about freedom.

(Jean-Jacques Rousseau, *Second Treatise on Inequality*)
