<p>Everyone wants to know how my month offline was. They ask it casually, like &ldquo;How&rsquo;s work going?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do this weekend?&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not a casual question. It was a huge, incredible, transformative experience. Those 30 days felt like six months. My habits changed, my relationships changed, my identity changed, my personality changed &mdash; hell, the physical shape of my body changed dramatically. I went through four legal pads trying to describe what it was like. I&rsquo;m still not sure I really know.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, though: my normal life style isn&rsquo;t healthy. This doesn&rsquo;t seem like the kind of thing that requires a break to learn. I imagine people with unhealthy lifestyles <em>know</em> they&rsquo;re unhealthy. They come home after work and say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; they cry randomly in elevators. But I didn&rsquo;t know. Life online is practically the only life I know. Sure, I guess things were different when I was very young &mdash; I remember, after getting my first email account, wishing someone would email me so I&rsquo;d have an email to answer (even then I knew I&rsquo;d soon be missing those empty-inbox days) &mdash; but for most of my life, this has been it: a jumble of interruptions and requests and jobs and people, largely carried out alone. It never let up, so I never saw anything different. How was I to know there was anything wrong?</p>

<p>But the last few weeks have made it clear there was &mdash; is. These weeks haven&rsquo;t felt that different my other weeks online, really &mdash; same jumble of work and people and interruptions as always. The usual sense that I&rsquo;m never really <em>here</em>, I&rsquo;m always worried about the million things around the corner: a todo list that goes for pages, a thousand emails to respond to, hundreds of blog posts to read, twenty open tabs, a dozen IM windows, a text message to answer, a Twitter stream to catch up on. I never used to think about these things as a benefit <em>or</em> a distraction &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t think about them at all; they were just how life online was. This was the era of multitasking and I was its child. If I felt anything about it, it was pride &mdash; a kind of joy in (mostly) managing to handle a thousand different things thrown my way at once. But I never knew what life was like when things <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> constantly being thrown at you. Until it stopped, I never knew how awful it really was.</p>

<p>I am not happy. I used to think of myself as just an unhappy person: a misanthrope, prone to mood swings and eating binges, who spends his days moping around the house in his pajamas, too shy and sad to step outside. But that&rsquo;s not how I was offline. I loved people &mdash; everyone from the counter clerk to the old friends I bumped into on the street. And I loved to go for walks and exercise in the gym and &mdash; even though there was no one around to see me &mdash; groom. Yes, groom: shower and shave and put on nice clothes and comb my hair and clean up my nails and so on, all things a month ago I would have said went against my very nature, things I never did before <em>voluntarily</em>.</p>

<p>But most of all, I felt not just happy, but firmly happy &mdash; solid, is the best way I can put it. I felt like I was in control of my life instead of the other way around, like its challenges just bounced off me as I kept doing what I wanted. Normally I feel buffeted by events, a thousand tiny distractions nagging at the back of my head at all times. Offline, I felt in control of my own destiny. I felt, yes, serene.</p>

<p>When I was very young, my parents introduced me to a book called <em><a href="http://books.theinfo.org/go/0061339202">Flow</a></em>. It argued that people good at their jobs went into a sort of flow state &mdash; they were &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; &mdash; where the normal stress of the world faded away and all their concentration was focused on the task at hand. It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fun&rdquo; the way ice cream or sex is fun &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t make you smile, just look grimly determined &mdash; but it was somehow more than that. It was <em>fulfilling</em>. And that was even better than a smile.</p>

<p>I go into such states when programming or writing and they are indeed fantastic, but also weirdly hollow. When you come out the real world &mdash; with its mundane stresses and distractions &mdash; comes crashing back in, and the moment of flow seems like just another temporary escape, an elusive dream. And it&rsquo;s a hard one to get back.</p>

<p>I still had flow states while offline &mdash; stronger than ever, in fact: I spent an ecstatic afternoon and evening writing longhand in a trance, pouring out the first forty pages of the book I&rsquo;ve been researching; afterward, I was on a bigger high than I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life &mdash; but they didn&rsquo;t feel like escapes. Normal days weren&rsquo;t painful anymore. I didn&rsquo;t spend them filled with worry, like before. Offline, I felt solid and composed. Online, I feel like my brain wants to run off in a million different directions, even when I try to point it forward.</p>

<p>A friend asked me if I knew I was privileged to be able to take such a break. It seemed a silly question: I feel privileged every day. As I write, my best friend is broke and homeless, much of the world struggles just to stay alive. I feel privileged to own a mattress, let alone take a break.</p>

<p>I realize everyone&rsquo;s lives are filled with work and people and distractions &mdash; the situation brewing at the office, the sump pump breaking down at the house, the family member who&rsquo;s fallen ill. I realize it must seem like the greatest arrogance to think one could escape life&rsquo;s mundane concerns, like asking to live on a cloud, floating above the mere mortals. But it was that arrogance that made me think I could contribute to adult mailing lists when I was still in elementary school, that arrogance that made me think someone might want to read my website when I was still just a teen, that arrogance that had me start a company as a college freshman. That sort of arrogance &mdash; not bragging, but simply inwardly thinking I could do more than was expected of me &mdash; is the only thing that&rsquo;s gotten me anywhere in life. I see no reason to stop now.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to carve a life away from the world&rsquo;s constant demands and distractions. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to balance all the things I want to do with the pressures and responsibilities they bring. But after my month off, I do know one thing: I can&rsquo;t go on like this. So I&rsquo;m damn well going to try.</p>
