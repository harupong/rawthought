<h1>Understanding Economic Jargon</h1>
<div>November 25, 2005</div>

<p>These days it seems like economists are everywhere &mdash; the newspaper, the television, the school system, the bookstore &mdash; speaking in their own special brand of jargon, a language I call &ldquo;economese&rdquo;. Understanding what they mean is often difficult without formal training, so I&rsquo;ve put together this helpful guide on the subject.</p>

        <td>What Americans need most is a <ins>strong religious upbringing</ins>.
